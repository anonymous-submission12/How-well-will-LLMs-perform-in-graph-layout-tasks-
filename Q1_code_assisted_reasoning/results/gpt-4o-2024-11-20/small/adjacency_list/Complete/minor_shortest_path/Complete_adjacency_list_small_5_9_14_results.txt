Here is the Python code to calculate and print the shortest path length between nodes '9' and '14':

```python
from collections import deque

def shortest_path_length(adj_list, start, end):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (current_node, distance)
    while queue:
        node, distance = queue.popleft()
        if node == end:
            return distance
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    queue.append((neighbor, distance + 1))
    return -1  # if no path exists
