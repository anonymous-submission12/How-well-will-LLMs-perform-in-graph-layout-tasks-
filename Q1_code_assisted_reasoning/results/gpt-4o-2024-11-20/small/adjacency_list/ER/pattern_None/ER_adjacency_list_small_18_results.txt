Here is the Python code to determine the graph pattern:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import numpy as np
import itertools

# Input graph as adjacency list
graph = {
    0: [7, 16, 18, 28], 1: [5, 11, 12, 27], 2: [5, 11, 20], 
    3: [7, 14, 18, 22], 4: [10], 5: [1, 2, 23], 6: [13, 14, 16, 28], 
    7: [0, 3, 10, 13, 24], 8: [25, 27], 9: [10, 20, 24], 
    10: [4, 7, 9, 12, 19, 22, 23], 11: [1, 2, 12, 22, 24, 28], 
    12: [1, 10, 11, 27], 13: [6, 7, 24, 28], 14: [3, 6, 17, 26, 28],

    21: [15, 20], 22: [3, 10, 11, 25], 23: [5, 10, 26], 
    24: [7, 9, 11, 13, 16], 25: [8, 22], 26: [14, 23], 
    27: [1, 8, 12, 15, 16], 28: [0, 6, 11, 13, 14, 18, 19]
}

            return False
