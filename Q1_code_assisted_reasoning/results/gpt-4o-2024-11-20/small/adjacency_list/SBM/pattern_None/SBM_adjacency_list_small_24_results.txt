Here is the Python code to determine the type of graph for your given adjacency list:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Input graph
graph = {0: [1, 2, 3], 1: [0, 3, 4, 5], 2: [0, 3, 4, 5], 3: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5], 
         4: [1, 2, 3, 5, 22], 5: [1, 2, 3, 4, 14], 6: [7, 8, 10], 
         7: [6, 8, 9, 10, 11], 8: [6, 7, 9, 10, 11], 9: [7, 8, 10, 11], 
         10: [6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 26], 11: [7, 8, 9, 10], 12: [13, 16, 17], 
         13: [12, 15, 16, 17, 25], 14: [5, 15, 16, 17, 19], 15: [13, 14, 16, 17],

         19: [14, 18, 20, 21], 20: [18, 19, 21, 22], 21: [18, 19, 20, 22], 
         22: [4, 18, 20, 21], 23: [24, 25, 26, 27], 24: [23, 26, 27], 
         25: [13, 23, 26, 27], 26: [10, 23, 24, 25, 27], 27: [23, 24, 25, 26]}
