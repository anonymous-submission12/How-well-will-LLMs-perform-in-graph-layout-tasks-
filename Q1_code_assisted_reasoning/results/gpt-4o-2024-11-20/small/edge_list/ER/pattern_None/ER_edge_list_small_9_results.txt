Here is the Python code for analyzing the pattern of the graph:

```python
import networkx as nx

edge_list = [
    (0, 11), (0, 26), (1, 7), (2, 12), (2, 13), (2, 14), (2, 15), (2, 23),
    (3, 5), (3, 11), (3, 14), (3, 16), (3, 19), (4, 7), (4, 10), (4, 19), 
    (4, 20), (4, 23), (4, 28), (4, 29), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 14), (5, 16), 
    (5, 20), (5, 29), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 12), (6, 23), (6, 28), (7, 13),
    (7, 14), (7, 21), (8, 14), (8, 16), (8, 24), (8, 25), (8, 27), (9, 17),
    (9, 18), (9, 23), (10, 27), (11, 22), (12, 23), (14, 25), (14, 26), 
    (15, 24), (15, 27), (15, 28), (15, 29), (16, 17), (16, 24), (16, 28), 
    (16, 29), (17, 18), (18, 19), (18, 29), (19, 24), (19, 28), (20, 24), 
    (20, 25), (21, 28), (22, 27), (24, 29)
]

G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

def determine_pattern(graph):
    # Check for specific graph structures
    nodes = list(graph.nodes)
    edges = list(graph.edges)
    n = len(nodes)
    e = len(edges)

    # Check for Star graph

    if e == n - 1 and all(graph.degree(node) <= 2 for node in nodes):
        return "Path"

    # Check for Grid graph (approximate check based on degree and edge count)
    sqrt_n = int(n ** 0.5)
    if n == sqrt_n ** 2 and e == 2 * sqrt_n * (sqrt_n - 1):
        return "Grid"

    # Check for Complete graph
    if e == n * (n - 1) // 2:
        return "Complete"

    # Check for Clustered graph
    # Count connected components and check for clique-like structures
    components = list(nx.connected_components(graph))
    if len(components) > 1:
        return "Clustered graph"

    # If none of the above, assume Random graph
    return "Random graph"
