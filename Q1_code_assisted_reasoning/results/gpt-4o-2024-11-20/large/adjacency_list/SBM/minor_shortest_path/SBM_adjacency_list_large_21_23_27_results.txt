Here's a Python code snippet that uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path between nodes '23' and '27' in the given graph:

```python
from collections import deque

# Define the adjacency list
graph = {

```

This code uses BFS to find the shortest path between nodes '23' and '27' in the graph. It prints the length of the shortest path.
