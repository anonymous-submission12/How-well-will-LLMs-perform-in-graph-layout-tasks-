Here is the Python code to count the number of communities in the graph based on the adjacency list provided:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Input graph adjacency list
graph = {0: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14], 1: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 22], 2: [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 14], 3: [1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14], 4: [0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], 5: [0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 11, 14], 6: [0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16], 7: [0, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 14], 8: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14], 9: [0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 14], 10: [0, 3, 4, 6, 8, 13], 11: [2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 13], 12: [0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 13], 13: [1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14], 14: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13], 15: [16, 17, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27], 16: [6, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 27, 28], 17: [15, 18, 21, 23, 25, 28, 42], 18: [16, 17, 22, 25, 26, 27], 19: [21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28], 20: [15, 16, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28], 21: [15, 16, 17, 19, 22, 23, 25, 26], 22: [1, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28], 23: [15, 17, 20, 21, 22, 24, 27], 24: [15, 19, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28, 41], 25: [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 26, 27, 28], 26: [15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25], 27: [15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 28], 28: [16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 27], 32: [29, 30, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42], 33: [29, 30, 31, 35, 37, 38, 39, 41], 34: [29, 30, 31, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40], 35: [29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42], 36: [30, 31, 32, 34, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42], 37: [29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 39], 38: [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 40, 41], 39: [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 40, 41], 40: [29, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 41], 41: [24, 29, 30, 32, 33, 35, 38, 39, 40], 42: [17, 30, 31, 32, 35, 36], 29: [32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 39, 40, 41], 30: [32, 33, 34, 36, 39, 41, 42], 31: [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 42]}
