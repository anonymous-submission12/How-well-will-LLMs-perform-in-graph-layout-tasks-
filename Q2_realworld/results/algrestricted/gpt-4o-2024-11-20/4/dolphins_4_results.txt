Here is a Python script to generate a layout for the graph from the given edge list using a modularity-based community detection algorithm. We will implement a simple layout algorithm that places nodes in different regions of the coordinate space to highlight community structures. The resulting layout will be printed in JSON format.

This implementation uses the `community-louvain` module for community detection and calculates positions without relying on existing layout algorithms like `spring_layout`.

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import random
import json

def generate_layout(edge_list):
    # Create the graph
    G = nx.Graph()
    G.add_edges_from(edge_list)
    
    # Perform community detection
    partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)
    
    # Group nodes by community
    communities = {}
    for node, community_id in partition.items():
        if community_id not in communities:
            communities[community_id] = []
        communities[community_id].append(node)
    
    # Generate layout
    positions = {}
    num_communities = len(communities)
    angle_step = 360 / num_communities  # Spread communities evenly in a circle
    
    for i, (community_id, nodes) in enumerate(communities.items()):
        angle = angle_step * i
        center_x = 10 * (i + 1) * random.uniform(0.75, 1.25) * random.choice([-1, 1])
        center_y = 10 * (i + 1) * random.uniform(0.75, 1.25)
        # large
