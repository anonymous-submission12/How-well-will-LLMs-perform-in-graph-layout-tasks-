We can identify the communities by performing a connected components analysis on the graph.

Let's analyze the provided adjacency list:

*   **Nodes 0-6:** These nodes are all interconnected.
*   **Nodes 7-13:** These nodes are all interconnected.
*   **Nodes 14-20:** These nodes are all interconnected.

Now let's check for any connections *between* these groups:

*   Node 0 is connected to 11 and 13, which are part of the 7-13 group. So, group 0-6 and 7-13 are actually part of a larger single group.
*   Node 14 is connected to 0. So group 14-20 is connected to group 0-13.
*   Node 1 is connected to 19, so group 0-6 is also linked to group 14-20
*   Node 4 is connected to 18, so group 0-6 is also linked to group 14-20
*   Node 5 is connected to 9, so group 0-6 is also linked to group 7-13
*   Node 10 is connected to 0, so group 7-13 is also linked to group 0-6

Therefore, all the nodes are connected to each other. So, there is only one single community in the graph.
