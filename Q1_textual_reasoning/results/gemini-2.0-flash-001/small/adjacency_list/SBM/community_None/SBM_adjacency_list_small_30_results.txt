Here's how we can determine the number of communities in the graph using a connected components approach. We'll treat each connected component as a community.

```python
def count_communities(graph):
    """
    Counts the number of connected components (communities) in a graph represented as an adjacency list.

    Args:
        graph: A dictionary representing the graph where keys are nodes and values are lists of neighbors.

    Returns:
        The number of connected components in the graph.
    """

    visited = set()
    count = 0

    def dfs(node):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor)

    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            dfs(node)
            count += 1

    return count

graph_data = {
    0: [2, 3, 4, 12],

    20: [14, 15, 17, 18, 19]
}

num_communities = count_communities(graph_data)
