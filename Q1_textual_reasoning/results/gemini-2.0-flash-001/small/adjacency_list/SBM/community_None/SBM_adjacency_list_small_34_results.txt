Here's how we can determine the number of communities in the provided graph using the adjacency list representation. We can identify communities by performing a connected components analysis.

The adjacency list represents the following connections:

*   **Community 1:** Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
*   **Community 2:** Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
*   **Community 3:** Nodes 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
*   **Community 4:** Nodes 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

These are all disjointed connected components of the provided graph. Thus, there are 4 communities in the given graph.
