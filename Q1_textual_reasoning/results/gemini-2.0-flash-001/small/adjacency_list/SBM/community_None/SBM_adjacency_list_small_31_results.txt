Here's how to determine the number of communities in the graph using a connected components approach:

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create a `visited` set to keep track of visited nodes.
2.  **Iteration:** Iterate through each node in the graph.
3.  **Check if Visited:** If a node hasn't been visited, it means a new community might start from this node.
4.  **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Perform a DFS starting from the unvisited node to explore its entire connected component (community).  Mark all visited nodes in the `visited` set.
5.  **Increment Count:**  Each time a DFS starts from an unvisited node, increment the community count.

```python
def count_communities(adj_list):
    """
    Counts the number of communities in a graph represented by an adjacency list.

    Args:
      adj_list: A dictionary representing the adjacency list of the graph.

    Returns:
      The number of communities (connected components) in the graph.
    """

    visited = set()
    community_count = 0

    def dfs(node):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor)

    for node in adj_list:
        if node not in visited:
            dfs(node)
            community_count += 1

    return community_count
