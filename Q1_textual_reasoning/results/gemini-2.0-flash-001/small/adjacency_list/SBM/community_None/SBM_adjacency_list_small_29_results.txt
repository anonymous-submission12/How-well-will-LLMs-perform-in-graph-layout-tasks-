We can identify the communities by performing a connected components analysis on the graph.  A connected component is a set of nodes where there is a path between any two nodes in the set, and the set is not connected to any other nodes in the graph.

Looking at the adjacency list, we can identify the following connected components:

*   **Community 1:** Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 17, 19. Notice that 17 connects to 0, 4 and 19 connects to 6, so these nodes are within the same community.
*   **Community 2:** Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
*   **Community 3:** Nodes 16, 18, 20, 21, 22.

Therefore, there are 3 communities in the graph.
