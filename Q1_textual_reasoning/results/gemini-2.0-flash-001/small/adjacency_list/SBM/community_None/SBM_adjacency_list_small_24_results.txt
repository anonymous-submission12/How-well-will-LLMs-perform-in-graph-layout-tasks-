We can identify the communities by finding the connected components of the graph.

1.  **Nodes 0-5:** These nodes are all connected to each other, forming one community.
2.  **Nodes 6-11:** These nodes are all connected to each other, forming another community.
3.  **Nodes 12-17:** These nodes are all connected to each other, forming another community.
4.  **Nodes 18-22:** These nodes are all connected to each other, forming another community.
5.  **Nodes 23-27:** These nodes are all connected to each other, forming another community.

Therefore, there are 5 communities in the graph.
