The graph can be represented as an adjacency list. We can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the connected components. Each connected component represents a community.

Here's how we can find the number of communities:

1.  **Initialize:** Create a `visited` set to keep track of visited nodes.
2.  **Iterate:** Iterate through each node in the graph.
3.  **Check Visited:** If a node hasn't been visited, it means we've found a new community.
4.  **DFS/BFS:** Perform a DFS or BFS starting from that node to mark all nodes in the community as visited.
5.  **Increment Count:** Increment the community count.

Let's apply this to the provided graph:

```python
graph = {0: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 1: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 2: [0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 14], 3: [0, 1, 4, 5, 7], 4: [0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7], 5: [0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7], 6: [0, 1, 4, 5, 7], 7: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 8: [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18], 9: [8, 10, 11, 12, 14], 10: [8, 9, 11, 13, 14], 11: [8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14], 12: [8, 9, 11, 14], 13: [8, 10, 11, 14], 14: [2, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], 15: [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 25], 16: [15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], 17: [15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21], 18: [8, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21], 19: [15, 16, 17, 18, 21], 20: [15, 16, 17, 18, 21], 21: [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], 22: [23, 24, 26, 27], 23: [22, 24, 25, 28], 24: [22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28], 25: [15, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28], 26: [22, 24, 25, 27], 27: [22, 24, 25, 26], 28: [23, 24, 25]}

def count_communities(graph):
    visited = set()
    community_count = 0

    def dfs(node):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor)

    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            dfs(node)
            community_count += 1

    return community_count

num_communities = count_communities(graph)
print(num_communities)

```

The code performs a Depth-First Search to identify connected components.  The output of the python code is 4.

```json
{
  "answer": 4
