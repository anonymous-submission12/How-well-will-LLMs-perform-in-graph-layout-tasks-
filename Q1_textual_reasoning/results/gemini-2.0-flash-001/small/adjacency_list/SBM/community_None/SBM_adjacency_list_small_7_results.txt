We can identify the communities in the graph using connected components. Two nodes belong to the same community if there is a path between them. We can use Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) to find the connected components.

Here's how we can determine the communities based on the provided adjacency list:

*   **Community 1:** {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 15} - All these nodes are connected.
*   **Community 2:** {7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13} - These nodes are connected.
*   **Community 3:** {14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20} - These nodes are connected.

Node 8 and 15 appear to connect community 1 and 2, and community 1 and 3, respectively. So we need to verify. Based on the adjacency list, node 8 belongs to both community 1 and 2. Also node 15 belongs to community 1 and 3.

Therefore we conclude there are 3 communities.
