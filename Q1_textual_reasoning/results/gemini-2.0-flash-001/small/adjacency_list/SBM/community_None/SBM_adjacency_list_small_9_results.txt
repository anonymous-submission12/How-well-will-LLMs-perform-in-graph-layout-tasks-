Here's how we can determine the number of communities using a simple connected components approach:

```python
def count_communities(adj_list):
    """
    Counts the number of connected components (communities) in a graph represented
    as an adjacency list.

    Args:
        adj_list: A dictionary representing the adjacency list of the graph.
                  Keys are nodes, and values are lists of their neighbors.

    Returns:
        The number of connected components in the graph.
    """

    visited = set()
    count = 0

    def dfs(node):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in adj_list.get(node, []):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor)

    for node in adj_list:
        if node not in visited:
            dfs(node)
            count += 1

    return count
