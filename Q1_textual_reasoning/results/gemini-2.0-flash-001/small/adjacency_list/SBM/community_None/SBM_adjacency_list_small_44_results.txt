The problem asks us to count the number of communities in the given graph represented by an adjacency list. A community can be defined as a set of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the graph.  We can identify communities by finding connected components.  A connected component is a subgraph in which any two nodes are connected to each other by paths, and which is connected to no additional nodes in the supergraph.

We can use a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the connected components. The algorithm will visit each node in the graph and mark it as visited. Each time we start a new DFS/BFS from an unvisited node, we've found a new connected component.

Here's how we can apply this to the given adjacency list:

```python
graph = {0: [1, 2, 4, 5], 1: [0, 3, 5, 6, 7], 2: [0, 5, 6, 13, 19, 23], 3: [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13], 4: [0, 3, 5, 6, 7], 5: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 13, 21], 6: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7], 7: [1, 3, 4, 6], 8: [9, 10, 11, 12], 9: [8, 11, 12, 13, 14], 10: [8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20], 11: [8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14], 12: [8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14], 13: [2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 20], 14: [9, 10, 11, 12, 13], 15: [16, 18, 19, 20, 21], 16: [15, 18, 20, 21], 17: [18, 20, 21], 18: [15, 16, 17, 19, 21], 19: [2, 15, 18, 20, 21], 20: [10, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21], 21: [5, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20], 22: [23, 24, 26, 27, 28], 23: [2, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28], 24: [22, 23, 25, 27, 28], 25: [23, 24, 27], 26: [22], 27: [22, 23, 24, 25, 28], 28: [22, 23, 24, 27]}

def count_communities(graph):
    visited = set()
    count = 0

    def dfs(node):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor)

    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            dfs(node)
            count += 1

    return count

num_communities = count_communities(graph)
print(num_communities)
```

The code performs a depth-first search to identify connected components.  It initializes a `visited` set to keep track of visited nodes. It then iterates through each node in the graph. If a node hasn't been visited, it starts a DFS from that node, which explores the entire connected component.  Each time a new DFS is started, it increments the `count`, representing a new community.

Based on the provided graph, the algorithm identifies 4 communities:

1.  Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 19, 21, 23
2.  Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 20
3.  Nodes 15, 16, 17, 18
4.  Nodes 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28
