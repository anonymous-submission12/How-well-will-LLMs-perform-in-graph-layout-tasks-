We can use the connected components algorithm to find the number of communities in the graph.

```python
def count_communities(adj_list):
    """
    Counts the number of connected components (communities) in a graph represented as an adjacency list.

    Args:
        adj_list: A dictionary representing the adjacency list of the graph.

    Returns:
        The number of connected components in the graph.
    """

    num_nodes = len(adj_list)
    visited = [False] * num_nodes
    count = 0

    def dfs(node):
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                dfs(neighbor)

    for node in range(num_nodes):
        if not visited[node]:
            dfs(node)
            count += 1

    return count
