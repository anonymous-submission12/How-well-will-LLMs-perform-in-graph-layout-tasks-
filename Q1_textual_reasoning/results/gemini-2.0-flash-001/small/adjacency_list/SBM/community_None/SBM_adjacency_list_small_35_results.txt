The problem asks to count the number of communities in a given graph represented by its adjacency list.  A community is a set of nodes that are densely connected internally, but sparsely connected to nodes in other communities. We can identify the communities by finding connected components in the graph. We can use Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) to find the connected components.

Here's how we can approach this problem:

1.  **Initialize:**
    *   Create a `visited` set to keep track of visited nodes.
    *   Initialize a `count` variable to 0.

2.  **Iterate through all nodes:**
    *   For each node in the graph:
        *   If the node has not been visited:
            *   Increment the `count` (found a new community).
            *   Perform DFS or BFS starting from that node to mark all reachable nodes as visited.

3.  **Return the count:**
    *   The final value of `count` will be the number of communities.

Based on the provided adjacency list, let's manually perform the community detection:

*   Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 form one community.
*   Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 form one community.
*   Nodes 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 form one community.
*   Nodes 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 form one community.

Therefore, there are 4 communities.
