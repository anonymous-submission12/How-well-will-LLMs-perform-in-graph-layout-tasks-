Here's how we can determine the number of communities in the graph represented by the given adjacency list.  We can use a connected components algorithm to find the communities.

```python
def count_communities(graph):
    """
    Counts the number of connected components (communities) in a graph.

    Args:
        graph: A dictionary representing the graph in adjacency list format.

    Returns:
        The number of connected components in the graph.
    """

    visited = set()
    count = 0

    def dfs(node, visited, graph):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor, visited, graph)

    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            dfs(node, visited, graph)
            count += 1

    return count
