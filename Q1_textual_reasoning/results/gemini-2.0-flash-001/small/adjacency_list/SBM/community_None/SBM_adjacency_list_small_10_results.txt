We can identify communities by finding connected components in the graph. Two nodes belong to the same community if there is a path between them. We can use a simple depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to find the connected components.

Here's how we can do it:

1.  Initialize a `visited` set to keep track of visited nodes.
2.  Iterate through each node in the graph.
3.  If a node is not visited, it means we've found a new community.
4.  Perform a DFS/BFS starting from that node to mark all reachable nodes as visited.
5.  Increment the community count.

```python
def count_communities(adj_list):
    """Counts the number of communities in a graph represented by an adjacency list."""

    num_nodes = len(adj_list)
    visited = [False] * num_nodes
    community_count = 0

    def dfs(node):
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                dfs(neighbor)

    for node in range(num_nodes):
        if not visited[node]:
            dfs(node)
            community_count += 1

    return community_count
