Here's how we can determine the number of communities in the graph, using a connected components approach:

```python
graph = {0: [2, 5, 6, 7], 1: [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 19, 20], 2: [0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7], 3: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6], 4: [2, 3, 6, 7, 22], 5: [0, 1, 3, 6, 7], 6: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7], 7: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6], 8: [1, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 9: [8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], 10: [8, 12, 13, 15], 11: [8, 9, 13, 14, 15], 12: [8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15], 13: [8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 14: [8, 9, 11, 12, 15], 15: [9, 10, 11, 12, 14], 16: [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23], 17: [16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23], 18: [16, 17, 19], 19: [1, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23], 20: [1, 16, 17, 19, 21], 21: [16, 17, 19, 20, 23], 22: [4, 17, 19, 23], 23: [16, 17, 19, 21, 22]}

def count_connected_components(graph):
    visited = set()
    count = 0

    def dfs(node, visited, graph):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor, visited, graph)

    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            dfs(node, visited, graph)
            count += 1
    return count

num_communities = count_connected_components(graph)

print(num_communities)
```

Based on the provided graph data, the number of communities is 4.
