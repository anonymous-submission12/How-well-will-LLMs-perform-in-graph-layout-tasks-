We can identify the communities by finding connected components in the graph. Two nodes belong to the same community if there is a path between them.

Here's how we can find the connected components:

1.  Initialize `visited` as an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.
2.  Iterate through each node in the graph.
3.  If a node has not been visited, perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from that node to find all reachable nodes.
4.  Mark all reachable nodes as visited.
5.  Each time we start a new DFS/BFS, it indicates a new connected component (community).
6.  Count the number of times a new DFS/BFS is initiated.

In the given graph, we can observe the following community structure:

*   Nodes 0-12 form one community.
*   Nodes 13-25 form another community.

Therefore, there are 2 communities in the graph.
