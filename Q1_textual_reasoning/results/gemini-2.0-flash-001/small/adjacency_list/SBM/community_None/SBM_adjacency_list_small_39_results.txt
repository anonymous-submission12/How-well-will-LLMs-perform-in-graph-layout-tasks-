Based on the provided adjacency list, we can identify the connected components, which correspond to the communities.

The graph consists of the following nodes: 0-22.

Nodes 0-11 form a highly interconnected component.
Nodes 12-22 form another highly interconnected component.

Therefore, there are two distinct communities in the graph.
