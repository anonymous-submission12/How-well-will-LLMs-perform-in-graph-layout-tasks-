Based on the provided graph, we can determine the shortest path length between node '1' and node '11'. The graph is represented as an adjacency list.

The adjacency list shows that node '0' is connected to all nodes from '1' to '25', and each node from '1' to '25' is only connected to node '0'.

Therefore, the shortest path from node '1' to node '11' is: 1 -> 0 -> 11.  This path has a length of 2.
