The graph is represented as an adjacency list. We are looking for the shortest path between node 15 and node 21.

The adjacency list shows the following connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]
- Nodes 1 to 26 are only connected to node 0.

Therefore, to go from node 15 to node 21, the shortest path is:
1. From node 15 to node 0 (length 1)
2. From node 0 to node 21 (length 1)
So, the shortest path length is 1 + 1 = 2.
