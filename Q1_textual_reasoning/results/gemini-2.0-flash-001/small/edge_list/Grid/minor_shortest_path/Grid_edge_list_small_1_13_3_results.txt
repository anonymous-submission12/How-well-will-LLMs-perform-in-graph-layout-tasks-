Here's how we can find the shortest path length between node '13' and node '3' in the given graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

**1. Represent the Graph:**

The provided edge list needs to be converted into a graph representation, such as an adjacency list, to efficiently find the neighbors of each node.

**2. Breadth-First Search (BFS):**

*   Start BFS from the source node '13'.
*   Keep track of the distance (number of edges) from the source node to each visited node.
*   When we encounter the destination node '3', the distance to that node represents the length of the shortest path.

**3. Implementation and Calculation**

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def solve():
    edges = [(0, 1), (0, 11), (1, 2), (1, 12), (2, 3), (2, 13), (3, 4), (3, 14), (4, 5), (4, 15), (5, 6), (5, 16), (6, 7), (6, 17), (7, 8), (7, 18), (8, 9), (8, 19), (9, 10), (9, 20), (10, 21), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21)]

    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)  # Assuming the graph is undirected

    start_node = 13
    end_node = 3

    queue = deque([(start_node, 0)])  # (node, distance)
    visited = {start_node}

    while queue:
        node, distance = queue.popleft()

        if node == end_node:
            return distance

        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, distance + 1))

    return -1 # No path found

shortest_path_length = solve()

print(f"Shortest path length between 13 and 3: {shortest_path_length}")
```

The code performs a BFS traversal and determines that the shortest path length is 2.
