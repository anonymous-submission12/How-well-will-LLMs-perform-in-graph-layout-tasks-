The problem asks for the shortest path length between nodes 3 and 21 in the given graph. The graph is represented as an edge list. We can perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from node 3 to find the shortest path to node 21.

The edge list shows a clear path from 3 to 21.  The path is 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16 -> 17 -> 18 -> 19 -> 20 -> 21.

Counting the edges in this path, we have:
3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-8, 8-9, 9-10, 10-11, 11-12, 12-13, 13-14, 14-15, 15-16, 16-17, 17-18, 18-19, 19-20, 20-21.  There are 18 edges in the path.
