Here's how we can find the shortest path between nodes '16' and '8' in the given graph. The graph is represented as an edge list, which means we can traverse it using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path.

1.  **Represent the Graph:** We can represent the graph as an adjacency list (or dictionary) where keys are nodes and values are lists of their neighbors.

2.  **BFS Traversal:** Perform a BFS starting from node '16'. Keep track of the distance (number of edges) from the starting node.

3.  **Find Target:** When we encounter node '8' during the BFS, the distance we've tracked is the length of the shortest path.

4.  **Handle Disconnected Graph:** If we complete the BFS and haven't found node '8', it means there's no path between '16' and '8', and the distance is infinity (or -1 to indicate no path).

Based on the provided edge list:

*   0 -> 1, 27
*   1 -> 0, 2
*   2 -> 1, 3
*   3 -> 2, 4
*   4 -> 3, 5
*   5 -> 4, 6
*   6 -> 5, 7
*   7 -> 6, 8
*   8 -> 7, 9
*   9 -> 8, 10
*   10 -> 9, 11
*   11 -> 10, 12
*   12 -> 11, 13
*   13 -> 12, 14
*   14 -> 13, 15
*   15 -> 14, 16
*   16 -> 15, 17
*   17 -> 16, 18
*   18 -> 17, 19
*   19 -> 18, 20
*   20 -> 19, 21
*   21 -> 20, 22
*   22 -> 21, 23
*   23 -> 22, 24
*   24 -> 23, 25
*   25 -> 24, 26
*   26 -> 25, 27
*   27 -> 0, 26

Now, let's trace the path from 16 to 8:

1.  16 -> 15 (distance 1)
2.  15 -> 14 (distance 2)
3.  14 -> 13 (distance 3)
4.  13 -> 12 (distance 4)
5.  12 -> 11 (distance 5)
6.  11 -> 10 (distance 6)
7.  10 -> 9 (distance 7)
8.  9 -> 8 (distance 8)

Therefore, the shortest path length is 8.
