Here's how we can determine the number of communities in the given graph based on the provided edge list. The approach involves identifying connected components, as each connected component typically represents a community.

1.  **Nodes Present:** First, identify all unique nodes present in the graph. From the edge list, the nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22

2.  **Connected Components:** Iterate through the edge list and group the nodes into connected components. Two nodes are in the same component if there's a path between them.

    *   Component 1: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 18, 16}
    *   Component 2: {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}

3.  **Count the Components:** Count the number of connected components identified. In this case, we have 2 connected components.
