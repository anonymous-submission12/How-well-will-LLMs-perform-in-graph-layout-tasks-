Here's how we can determine the number of communities in the graph represented by the provided edge list. We can identify communities by finding connected components within the graph.  A connected component is a set of nodes where there is a path between any two nodes in the set.

Here's the breakdown of the communities based on the given edge list:

*   **Community 1:** Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 24 (These nodes are all interconnected)
*   **Community 2:** Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 (These nodes are all interconnected)
*   **Community 3:** Nodes 13, 16, 17, 14, 15, 18 (These nodes are all interconnected)
*   **Community 4:** Nodes 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23 (These nodes are all interconnected)

Therefore, there are 4 distinct communities in this graph.
