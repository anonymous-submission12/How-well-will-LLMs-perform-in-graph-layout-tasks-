Here's how we can determine the number of communities in the graph using a simple connected components approach:

1.  **Represent the graph:**  The provided edge list can be used to build a graph representation (either adjacency list or adjacency matrix).

2.  **Connected Components:**  We can find the connected components of the graph. Each connected component represents a community.  A connected component is a set of nodes where there is a path between any two nodes in the set.

3.  **Count the Components:** The number of connected components is the number of communities.

Here's the Python code to achieve this:

```python
def count_communities(edge_list):
    """Counts the number of communities (connected components) in a graph.

    Args:
        edge_list: A list of tuples representing the edges of the graph.

    Returns:
        The number of connected components (communities).
    """

    # 1. Build the graph (adjacency list representation)
    graph = {}
    for u, v in edge_list:
        if u not in graph:
            graph[u] = []
        if v not in graph:
            graph[v] = []
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)

    # 2. Find connected components using Depth First Search (DFS)
    visited = set()
    num_communities = 0

    def dfs(node, graph, visited):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor, graph, visited)

    nodes = set()
    for u,v in edge_list:
        nodes.add(u)
        nodes.add(v)

    for node in nodes:
        if node not in visited:
            dfs(node, graph, visited)
            num_communities += 1

    return num_communities
