Here's how we can determine the number of communities in the provided graph using a connected components approach. We treat each connected component as a distinct community.

1.  **Represent the Graph:** The input is an edge list.  We'll implicitly represent the graph using a set of nodes and a set of edges.

2.  **Find Connected Components:** We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the connected components.  We'll iterate through the nodes. If a node hasn't been visited yet, we start a DFS/BFS from that node to find all nodes reachable from it.  The set of visited nodes in that DFS/BFS constitutes a connected component.

3.  **Count Communities:** The number of times we initiate a DFS/BFS will be equal to the number of connected components, which corresponds to the number of communities.

Here's the implementation in Python to count the connected components:

```python
def count_communities(edge_list):
    """
    Counts the number of communities (connected components) in a graph represented by an edge list.
    """
    graph = {}
    for u, v in edge_list:
        if u not in graph:
            graph[u] = []
        if v not in graph:
            graph[v] = []
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)

    nodes = set()
    for u, v in edge_list:
        nodes.add(u)
        nodes.add(v)

    visited = set()
    community_count = 0

    def dfs(node):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor)

    for node in nodes:
        if node not in visited:
            dfs(node)
            community_count += 1

    return community_count

edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 21), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 15), (3, 4), (3, 24), (4, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (8, 9), (8, 10), (9, 10), (9, 21), (10, 11), (12, 14), (12, 15), (12, 16), (13, 15), (13, 16), (14, 26), (15, 16), (15, 18), (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 21), (18, 20), (18, 21), (19, 20), (19, 21), (20, 21), (22, 24), (22, 25), (22, 26), (23, 24), (23, 25), (23, 26), (24, 25), (24, 26), (25, 26)]
num_communities = count_communities(edge_list)

print(f"Number of communities: {num_communities}")
