Here's how we can determine the number of communities in the provided graph data:

**Understanding Community Structure**

Community structure in a graph means that nodes are more densely connected within their community than to nodes in other communities.  We're looking for groups of nodes that form relatively isolated clusters.

**Algorithm**

A simple approach to estimate the number of communities involves finding connected components. Each connected component is likely to be a community.

1.  **Build the Graph:**  Represent the edge list as a graph (e.g., using a dictionary or adjacency list).
2.  **Find Connected Components:** Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the connected components.  Each time you start a new DFS/BFS from an unvisited node, you've found a new component.

**Implementation (Conceptual)**

```python
def count_communities(edge_list):
    """Counts the number of communities in a graph represented by an edge list."""

    graph = {}  # Adjacency list representation
    for u, v in edge_list:
        if u not in graph:
            graph[u] = []
        if v not in graph:
            graph[v] = []
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)

    visited = set()
    community_count = 0

    def dfs(node):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor)

    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            community_count += 1
            dfs(node)  # Explore the connected component

    return community_count
```

**Applying to the Given Graph**

Applying this logic to the given edge list:

`[(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 11), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 9), (1, 10), (1, 11), (1, 21), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10), (2, 11), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), (3, 11), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 10), (5, 11), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 11), (6, 19), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (8, 9), (8, 11), (9, 10), (9, 12), (10, 11), (10, 12), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 15), (12, 17), (12, 19), (12, 20), (12, 21), (13, 14), (13, 16), (13, 17), (13, 18), (13, 19), (13, 20), (13, 21), (14, 16), (14, 18), (14, 19), (14, 20), (14, 21), (14, 22), (15, 16), (15, 18), (15, 20), (15, 21), (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 21), (16, 22), (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 20), (17, 21), (17, 22), (18, 20), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 21), (19, 22), (20, 22), (21, 22)]`

Visually inspecting (or running the code), we can see that all the nodes are connected in a single connected component.
