Here's how we can determine the number of communities in the provided graph using a simple connected components approach:

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialize:** Start with an empty list of communities.
2.  **Iterate through nodes:** For each node in the graph:
    *   If the node doesn't belong to any existing community, create a new community containing only that node.
    *   Find all neighbors of the current node.
    *   Add the neighbors to the same community as the current node.
    *   Merge communities if a node belongs to multiple communities.
3.  **Count Communities:** The number of communities in the list is the answer.

**Implementation (Conceptual):**

Based on the provided `edge_list`, we can identify the following connected components (communities):

*   Community 1: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 13, 14, 19, 18, 20, 15, 16, 17, 9, 7, 8, 10, 12}
*   Nodes: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 are highly connected and clearly belong to one community. Nodes 7,8,9,10,11,12,13 are connected. Nodes 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 are connected. But node 0 is connected to 11, 13, 14. Node 5 is connected to 9. Node 7 is connected to 11, 13, 14. So all nodes are in a single community.
