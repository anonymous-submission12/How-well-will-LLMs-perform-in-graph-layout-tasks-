Based on the provided edge list, we can identify the connected components, which correspond to the communities in the graph. By manually inspecting the edge list, the graph can be partitioned into the following connected components (communities):

*   {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17}
*   {7, 8, 9, 13}
*   {14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 26}
*   {21, 22, 23, 24, 25}

Thus, there are 4 distinct communities.
