Here's how we can determine the number of communities in the provided graph data by identifying connected components:

**Understanding the Approach**

The core idea is that nodes belonging to the same community are likely to be more densely connected to each other than to nodes in other communities.  We can identify communities by finding the connected components in the graph. A connected component is a set of nodes where there is a path between any two nodes in the set.

**Algorithm**

1.  **Initialize:** Create a set to store all the nodes in the graph.
2.  **Iterate through Nodes:** For each node in the graph:
    *   If the node hasn't been visited yet:
        *   Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from that node to find all reachable nodes.
        *   Mark all reachable nodes as visited.
        *   Increment the community count.
3.  **Return:** The final community count represents the number of connected components, and hence, the number of communities.

**Applying to the Graph Data**

```python
def count_communities(edge_list):
    """Counts the number of communities in a graph represented by an edge list."""

    nodes = set()
    for edge in edge_list:
        nodes.add(edge[0])
        nodes.add(edge[1])

    adj_list = {node: [] for node in nodes}
    for edge in edge_list:
        adj_list[edge[0]].append(edge[1])
        adj_list[edge[1]].append(edge[0])

    visited = {node: False for node in nodes}
    community_count = 0

    def dfs(node):
        visited[node] = True
        for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                dfs(neighbor)

    for node in nodes:
        if not visited[node]:
            dfs(node)
            community_count += 1

    return community_count

Based on the provided edge list, there are **2** communities. The nodes \[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 18] form one connected component, and the nodes \[14, 15, 17, 19, 20] form the other connected component.
