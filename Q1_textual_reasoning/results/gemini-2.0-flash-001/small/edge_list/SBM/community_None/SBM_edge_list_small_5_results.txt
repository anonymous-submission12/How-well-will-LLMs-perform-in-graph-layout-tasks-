Here's how we can determine the number of communities in the graph represented by the provided edge list using the concept of connected components:

**Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialize:** Create a set of all nodes present in the graph.
2.  **Iterate through edges:** Go through each edge in the edge list.
3.  **Build connected components:** Use a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) approach to identify all nodes that are reachable from a starting node. Each connected component represents a community.
4.  **Count communities:** The number of distinct connected components equals the number of communities.

**Implementation (Conceptual):**

Let's trace this with your graph:

Nodes = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26}

*   Starting from node 0, we can reach 1, 3, 4, and 5.  And from those, we can reach 2, 9, 17 and 26. So community 1: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 17, 26}
*   Starting from node 6, we can reach 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 24. And from those 13, 14, 15, 16. So community 2: {6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 24}
*   Starting from node 18, we can reach 19, 20, 21. So community 3: {17, 18, 19, 20, 21}
*   Starting from node 22, we can reach 23, 24, 25, 26. So community 4: {22, 23, 24, 25, 26}

Actually, the first community is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 26}.  The second community does not include node 9.
The third community does not include node 17. The fourth community includes node 24 and node 26.
So here are the communities:
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
{6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 24}
{17, 18, 19, 20, 21}
{22, 23, 24, 25, 26}

Therefore, there are 4 communities.
