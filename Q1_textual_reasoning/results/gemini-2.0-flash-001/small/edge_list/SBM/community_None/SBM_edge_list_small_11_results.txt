Based on the provided edge list, we can identify the connected components, which represent the communities in the graph. Let's analyze the connections:

*   **Community 1:** Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 are all interconnected.  Node 7 links to node 23 as well, making 23 a part of it.

*   **Community 2:** Nodes 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22 are interconnected and connected to 23, which is already part of community 1.

Therefore, there is only one community.
