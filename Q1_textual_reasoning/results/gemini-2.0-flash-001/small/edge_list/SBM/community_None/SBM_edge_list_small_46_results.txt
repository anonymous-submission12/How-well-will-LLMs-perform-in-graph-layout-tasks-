Here's how we can determine the number of communities in the graph represented by the provided edge list. The approach is to identify connected components, as each connected component represents a community.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Represent the graph:** We can represent the graph using an adjacency list or similar data structure.  The edge list provides the connections directly.

2. **Find Connected Components:** Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the graph and identify connected components. Each time we start a new DFS/BFS from an unvisited node, we've found a new component.

3. **Count Components:** The number of times we initiate a new DFS/BFS is the number of connected components, which corresponds to the number of communities.

Let's apply this to the provided edge list:

Edges: `[(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 12), (0, 17), (0, 19), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (4, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 10), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 17), (8, 9), (8, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), (12, 13), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (15, 16), (15, 17), (16, 17), (18, 20), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 21), (20, 21), (21, 22)]`

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22

By inspection (or by running the DFS/BFS algorithm), we can identify the connected components:

*   **Component 1:** 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22
*   **Component 2:** 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11

Therefore, there are **2** connected components, and hence 2 communities.
