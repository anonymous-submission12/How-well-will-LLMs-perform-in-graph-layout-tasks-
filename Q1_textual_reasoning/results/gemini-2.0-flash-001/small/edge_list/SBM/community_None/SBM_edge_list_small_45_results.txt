Based on the provided edge list, we can identify the connected components, which represent the communities. Let's analyze the connections:

*   Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are connected to each other. Node 6 is connected to this group via node 5.

*   Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 are connected to each other.

*   Nodes 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 are connected to each other.

*   Nodes 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 are connected to each other.

Therefore, there are 4 distinct connected components, indicating 4 communities.
