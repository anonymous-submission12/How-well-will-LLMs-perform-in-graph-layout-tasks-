Here's how we can determine the number of communities in the provided graph data. We can identify communities by finding connected components within the graph.  Nodes within the same connected component belong to the same community.

Based on the provided edge list, we can identify the following connected components (communities):

*   **Community 1:** {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
*   **Community 2:** {9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 24}
*   **Community 3:** {18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25}

Therefore, there are 3 distinct communities in the graph.
