Here's how we can determine the number of communities in the given graph data using a connected components approach. We treat each connected component as a community.

```python
def count_communities(edge_list):
    """
    Counts the number of communities in a graph represented by an edge list.

    Args:
        edge_list: A list of tuples representing the edges of the graph.

    Returns:
        The number of connected components (communities) in the graph.
    """

    # Build the graph as an adjacency list
    graph = {}
    for u, v in edge_list:
        if u not in graph:
            graph[u] = []
        if v not in graph:
            graph[v] = []
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)

    # Find all nodes in the graph
    nodes = set()
    for u, v in edge_list:
        nodes.add(u)
        nodes.add(v)

    # Function to perform Depth First Search (DFS)
    def dfs(node, visited, component):
        visited[node] = True
        component.append(node)
        for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
            if not visited.get(neighbor, False):
                dfs(neighbor, visited, component)

    # Find connected components
    visited = {}
    communities = []
    for node in nodes:
        if not visited.get(node, False):
            component = []
            dfs(node, visited, component)
            communities.append(component)

    return len(communities)
