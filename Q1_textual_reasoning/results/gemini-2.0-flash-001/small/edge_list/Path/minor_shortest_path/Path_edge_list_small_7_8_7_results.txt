Based on the provided graph represented as an edge list, we can determine the shortest path between node '8' and node '7'. The graph describes a linear chain of nodes.

The edge list shows a direct connection between node 7 and node 8: (7, 8).

Therefore, the shortest path length between node '8' and node '7' is 1.
