The graph is given as an edge list. To find the shortest path between nodes '17' and '21', we can perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from node '17'.

Here's how we can trace the path:
1. Start at node 17.
2. From 17, we can reach 18. (Distance: 1)
3. From 18, we can reach 19. (Distance: 2)
4. From 19, we can reach 20. (Distance: 3)
5. From 20, we can reach 21. (Distance: 4)

Therefore, the shortest path length between node 17 and node 21 is 4.
