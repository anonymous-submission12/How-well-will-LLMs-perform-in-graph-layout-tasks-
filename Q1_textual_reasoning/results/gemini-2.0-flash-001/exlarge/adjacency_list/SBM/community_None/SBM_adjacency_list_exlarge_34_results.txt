Based on the provided graph data in the adjacency list format, we can identify the connected components, which represent the communities. The nodes are: 0-15, 16-30, 31-45, 46-60, 61-75 and 62,63,65,67. We can manually examine the connectivity to determine the number of communities.

*   **Community 1:** Nodes 0-15 are interconnected.
*   **Community 2:** Nodes 16-30 are interconnected.
*   **Community 3:** Nodes 31-45 are interconnected.
*   **Community 4:** Nodes 46-60 are interconnected.
*   **Community 5:** Nodes 61-75 are interconnected.

Therefore, there are 5 communities in the graph.
