Based on the provided graph data in adjacency list format, we can identify the number of connected components, which in this context represents the number of communities.  We can use a simple depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) approach to traverse the graph and count the number of times we start a new traversal.

Here's how we can determine the number of communities:

1.  **Initialization:** Create a set to keep track of visited nodes.
2.  **Iteration:** Iterate through each node in the graph.
3.  **Check Visited:** If a node hasn't been visited, it means we've found a new community.
4.  **Traversal:** Perform DFS or BFS starting from that node to mark all nodes in the connected component as visited.
5.  **Increment Count:** Increment the community count.

Applying this to the given graph:

*   Nodes 0-26 are highly interconnected, forming one community.
*   Nodes 27-52 are highly interconnected, forming another community.
*   Nodes 53-78 are highly interconnected, forming another community.

Therefore, there are 3 communities.
