### Explanation:
The graph is structured such that node `0` is connected to all other nodes (including nodes `2` and `4`), and all other nodes are only connected back to node `0`. Therefore, the shortest path from node `2` to node `4` is:
- `2` → `0` → `4`

This path has a length of `2` (since it involves traversing two edges).
