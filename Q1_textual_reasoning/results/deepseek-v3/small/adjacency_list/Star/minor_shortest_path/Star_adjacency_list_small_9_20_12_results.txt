### Explanation:
The graph provided is a star graph where node `0` is connected to all other nodes (including `20` and `12`), and no other connections exist. To find the shortest path between node `20` and `12`:

1. Start at node `20`.
2. Move to node `0` (1 step).
3. Move from node `0` to node `12` (1 step).

Thus, the shortest path length is **2**.
