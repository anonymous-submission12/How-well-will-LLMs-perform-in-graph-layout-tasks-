### Explanation:
The graph provided is a star graph where node `0` is connected to all other nodes (including `13` and `19`), and all other nodes are only connected back to node `0`. 

To find the shortest path between node `13` and `19`:
1. Start at node `13`.
2. Move to node `0` (1 step).
3. Move from node `0` to node `19` (1 step).

Thus, the shortest path length is **2**.
