To find the shortest path between node '6' and node '4' in the given graph, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the adjacency list representation of the graph:

```json
{
  "0": [1],
  "1": [0, 2],
  "2": [1, 3],
  "3": [2, 4],
  "4": [3, 5],
  "5": [4, 6],
  "6": [5, 7],
  "7": [6, 8],
  "8": [7, 9],
  "9": [8, 10],
  "10": [9, 11],
  "11": [10, 12],
  "12": [11, 13],
  "13": [12, 14],
  "14": [13, 15],
  "15": [14, 16],
  "16": [15, 17],
  "17": [16, 18],
  "18": [17, 19],
  "19": [18, 20],
  "20": [19]
}
```

### Steps to find the shortest path:
1. Start at node '6'.
2. Explore its neighbors: '5' and '7'.
3. From '5', explore its neighbors: '4' and '6'.
4. From '7', explore its neighbors: '6' and '8'.
5. Continue this process until node '4' is found.

The shortest path from node '6' to node '4' is: `6 -> 5 -> 4`.

The length of this path is 2.
