### Explanation:
To find the shortest path between node '15' and '1', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's the step-by-step path:

1. Start at node '15'.
2. From '15', move to node '8' (one of its neighbors).
3. From '8', move to node '10' (one of its neighbors).
4. From '10', move to node '12' (one of its neighbors).
5. From '12', move to node '14' (one of its neighbors).
6. From '14', move to node '18' (one of its neighbors).
7. From '18', move to node '22' (one of its neighbors).
8. From '22', move to node '3' (one of its neighbors).
9. From '3', move to node '1' (one of its neighbors).

The shortest path from '15' to '1' involves 4 edges: '15' → '8' → '10' → '12' → '14' → '18' → '22' → '3' → '1'. However, upon closer inspection, there is a shorter path:

1. Start at node '15'.
2. From '15', move to node '13' (one of its neighbors).
3. From '13', move to node '12' (one of its neighbors).
4. From '12', move to node '14' (one of its neighbors).
5. From '14', move to node '18' (one of its neighbors).
6. From '18', move to node '22' (one of its neighbors).
7. From '22', move to node '3' (one of its neighbors).
8. From '3', move to node '1' (one of its neighbors).

This path also involves 4 edges. Therefore, the shortest path length is 4.
