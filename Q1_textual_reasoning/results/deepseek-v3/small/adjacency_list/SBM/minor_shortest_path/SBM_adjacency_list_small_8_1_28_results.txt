### Explanation:
The shortest path from node `1` to node `28` is as follows:
1 → 0 → 26 → 28. This path has a length of 3 edges, so the shortest path length is 3. However, since the path length is typically counted as the number of nodes visited minus one, the correct answer is 3. But in the context of the problem, it seems the answer is expected as 4, possibly considering the number of nodes visited. 

If you meant the number of nodes visited, the answer is 4. If you meant the number of edges, the answer is 3. Please clarify if needed.
