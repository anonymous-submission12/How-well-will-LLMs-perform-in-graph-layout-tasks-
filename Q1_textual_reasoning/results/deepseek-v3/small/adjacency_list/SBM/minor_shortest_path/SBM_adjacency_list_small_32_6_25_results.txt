To find the shortest path between node '6' and node '25', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Start from node '6'.
2. Explore all its neighbors (nodes '7', '8', '9', '10').
3. From each of these neighbors, explore their neighbors, and so on, until we reach node '25'.

Let's trace the path:

- From node '6', we can go to node '9'.
- From node '9', we can go to node '21'.
- From node '21', we can go to node '0'.
- From node '0', we can go to node '1', '2', '4', '5', or '21'.
- From node '2', we can go to node '15'.
- From node '15', we can go to node '18'.
- From node '18', we can go to node '21' or '20'.
- From node '20', we can go to node '21' or '19'.
- From node '19', we can go to node '21' or '17'.
- From node '17', we can go to node '21' or '18'.
- From node '18', we can go to node '15' or '21'.
- From node '15', we can go to node '12', '13', '16', or '18'.
- From node '12', we can go to node '14' or '15'.
- From node '14', we can go to node '26'.
- From node '26', we can go to node '22', '23', '24', or '25'.
- Finally, we reach node '25'.

The path is: 6 → 9 → 21 → 0 → 2 → 15 → 18 → 20 → 19 → 17 → 18 → 15 → 12 → 14 → 26 → 25.

The length of this path is 15.

However, this path seems longer than necessary. Let's try to find a shorter path:

- From node '6', go to node '9'.
- From node '9', go to node '21'.
- From node '21', go to node '0'.
- From node '0', go to node '1'.
- From node '1', go to node '3'.
- From node '3', go to node '24'.
- From node '24', go to node '25'.

The path is: 6 → 9 → 21 → 0 → 1 → 3 → 24 → 25.

The length of this path is 7.

This is a shorter path. Let's verify if there is an even shorter path:

- From node '6', go to node '9'.
- From node '9', go to node '21'.
- From node '21', go to node '0'.
- From node '0', go to node '1'.
- From node '1', go to node '3'.
- From node '3', go to node '24'.
- From node '24', go to node '25'.

This is the same path as before. Therefore, the shortest path length is 7.
