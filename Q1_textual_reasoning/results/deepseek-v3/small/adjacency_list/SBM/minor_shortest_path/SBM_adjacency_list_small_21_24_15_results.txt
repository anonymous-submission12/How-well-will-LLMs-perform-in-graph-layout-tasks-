To find the shortest path between node '24' and '15', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Start from node '24'.
2. Explore all its neighbors.
3. From each neighbor, explore their neighbors, and so on, until we reach node '15'.
4. Keep track of the number of steps taken to reach each node.

Let's perform the BFS:

- **Step 1**: Start at node '24'. Neighbors: [10, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29].
- **Step 2**: From node '10', neighbors: [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 24]. We find node '15' here.

So, the shortest path from '24' to '15' is: 24 → 10 → 15.

The length of this path is 2.
