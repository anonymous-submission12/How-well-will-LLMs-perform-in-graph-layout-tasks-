To find the shortest path between node '9' and node '7', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the adjacency list provided:

```json
{
  "0": [1, 4, 5, 8],
  "1": [0, 2, 5, 6, 24],
  "2": [1, 3, 5, 6],
  "3": [2, 4, 9],
  "4": [0, 3, 6],
  "5": [0, 1, 2, 6],
  "6": [1, 2, 4, 5],
  "7": [8, 9, 11, 12, 13],
  "8": [0, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14],
  "9": [3, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12],
  "10": [8, 9, 11, 12],
  "11": [7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 20],
  "12": [7, 9, 10, 11],
  "13": [7, 8, 11],
  "14": [8, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20],
  "15": [14, 18, 19, 20],
  "16": [14, 17, 19, 20],
  "17": [14, 16, 18, 19],
  "18": [15, 17, 20],
  "19": [14, 15, 16, 17],
  "20": [11, 14, 15, 16, 18],
  "21": [22, 23, 24, 26, 27],
  "22": [21, 25, 26, 27],
  "23": [21, 24, 25, 26, 27],
  "24": [1, 21, 23, 25, 26, 27],
  "25": [22, 23, 24, 27],
  "26": [21, 22, 23, 24, 27],
  "27": [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]
}
```

### BFS Algorithm Steps:
1. Start from node '9'.
2. Explore all its neighbors (nodes directly connected to it).
3. If node '7' is found among the neighbors, return the path length.
4. If not, continue exploring the neighbors of the neighbors, and so on, until node '7' is found.

### Shortest Path:
From the adjacency list, we can see that node '9' is directly connected to node '7'. Therefore, the shortest path length is 1.

{
  "answer": 1
