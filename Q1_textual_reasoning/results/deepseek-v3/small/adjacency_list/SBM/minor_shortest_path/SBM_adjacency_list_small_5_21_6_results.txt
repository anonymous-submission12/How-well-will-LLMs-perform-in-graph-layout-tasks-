### Explanation:
To find the shortest path between node '21' and '6', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's the step-by-step path:

1. **21 → 17**: Direct connection.
2. **17 → 2**: Direct connection.
3. **2 → 4**: Direct connection.
4. **4 → 26**: Direct connection.
5. **26 → 25**: Direct connection.
6. **25 → 24**: Direct connection.
7. **24 → 6**: Direct connection.

Thus, the shortest path from node '21' to '6' involves 6 edges, so the length of the shortest path is **6**.
