### Explanation:
To find the shortest path between node '7' and '13', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here is the path:

1. Start at node **7**.
2. Move to node **8** (7 → 8).
3. Move to node **6** (7 → 8 → 6).
4. Move to node **15** (7 → 8 → 6 → 15).
5. Move to node **14** (7 → 8 → 6 → 15 → 14).
6. Move to node **13** (7 → 8 → 6 → 15 → 14 → 13).

The shortest path length is **5**.
