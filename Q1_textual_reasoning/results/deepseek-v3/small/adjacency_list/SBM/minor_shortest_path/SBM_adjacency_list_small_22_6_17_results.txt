To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '6' and node '17', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Start from node '6'.
2. Explore all its neighbors (nodes directly connected to it).
3. From each neighbor, explore their neighbors, and so on, until node '17' is reached.
4. Keep track of the number of steps taken to reach node '17'.

Let's perform the BFS:

- **Step 0**: Start at node '6'.
- **Step 1**: Explore neighbors of '6' → [8, 9, 10, 11, 13].
- **Step 2**: Explore neighbors of '8' → [6, 9, 10, 11].
- **Step 2**: Explore neighbors of '9' → [6, 8, 10, 11].
- **Step 2**: Explore neighbors of '10' → [6, 7, 8, 9, 11].
- **Step 2**: Explore neighbors of '11' → [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
- **Step 2**: Explore neighbors of '13' → [6, 12, 15, 17, 25].

At this point, we have reached node '17' in 2 steps from node '13', which is a neighbor of node '6'. Therefore, the shortest path from node '6' to node '17' is 2 steps.
