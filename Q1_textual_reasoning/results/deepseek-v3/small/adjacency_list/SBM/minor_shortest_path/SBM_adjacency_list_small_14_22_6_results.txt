To find the shortest path between node '22' and node '6', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Start from node '22'.
2. Explore all its neighbors.
3. Continue exploring the neighbors of the neighbors until node '6' is found.

Let's perform the BFS:

- **Level 0**: Start at node '22'.
- **Level 1**: Neighbors of '22' are [4, 17, 19, 23].
- **Level 2**: Neighbors of '4' are [2, 3, 6, 7, 22]. We find node '6' here.

So, the shortest path from '22' to '6' is 2 steps.
