To find the shortest path between node '15' and '9', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Start from node '15'.
2. Explore all its neighbors.
3. Continue exploring the neighbors of the neighbors until node '9' is found.
4. Keep track of the number of steps taken to reach node '9'.

Let's perform the BFS:

- Start at node '15'.
- Neighbors of '15': [13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24].
- Explore node '14' (since it connects to node '9').
- Neighbors of '14': [8, 9, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24].
- Found node '9' in the neighbors of '14'.

The path is: 15 → 14 → 9.

The length of the shortest path is 2.
