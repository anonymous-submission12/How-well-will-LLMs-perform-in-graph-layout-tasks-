To find the shortest path between node '19' and '23', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the adjacency list provided:

```json
{
    0: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6],
    1: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    2: [0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8],
    3: [1, 5, 6, 7, 8],
    4: [0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8],
    5: [0, 1, 3, 4, 7],
    6: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7],
    7: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8],
    8: [1, 2, 3, 4, 7],
    9: [1, 10, 14, 16, 17, 22],
    10: [9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17],
    11: [10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 24],
    12: [10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17],
    13: [11, 12, 14, 15],
    14: [9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17],
    15: [10, 12, 13, 14, 17],
    16: [9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17],
    17: [9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16],
    18: [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25],
    19: [18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],
    20: [18, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25],
    21: [18, 19, 22, 23, 25],
    22: [9, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25],
    23: [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24],
    24: [11, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25],
    25: [18, 20, 21, 22, 24]
}
```

### BFS Algorithm Steps:
1. Start from node '19'.
2. Explore all its neighbors (nodes directly connected to it).
3. From each neighbor, explore their neighbors, and so on, until you reach node '23'.
4. Keep track of the number of steps taken to reach '23'.

### Shortest Path:
- From '19' to '23' directly: 1 step.

Thus, the shortest path length between node '19' and '23' is **1**.

    "answer": 1
