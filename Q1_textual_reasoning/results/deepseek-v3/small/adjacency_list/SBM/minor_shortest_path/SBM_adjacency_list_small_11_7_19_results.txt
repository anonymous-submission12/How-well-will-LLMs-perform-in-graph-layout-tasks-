To find the shortest path between node '7' and node '19', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Start from node '7'.
2. Explore all its neighbors (nodes directly connected to it).
3. From those neighbors, explore their neighbors, and so on, until we reach node '19'.
4. Keep track of the number of steps taken to reach node '19'.

Let's perform the BFS:

- **Step 0**: Start at node '7'.
- **Step 1**: Explore neighbors of '7' → [1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 23].
- **Step 2**: Explore neighbors of '1' → [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
- **Step 3**: Explore neighbors of '5' → [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10].
- **Step 4**: Explore neighbors of '6' → [1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 11].
- **Step 5**: Explore neighbors of '8' → [0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10].
- **Step 6**: Explore neighbors of '9' → [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11].
- **Step 7**: Explore neighbors of '10' → [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11].
- **Step 8**: Explore neighbors of '23' → [7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22].

At this point, we have reached node '19' from node '23' in 3 steps (7 → 23 → 19).

Thus, the shortest path from node '7' to node '19' has a length of 3.
