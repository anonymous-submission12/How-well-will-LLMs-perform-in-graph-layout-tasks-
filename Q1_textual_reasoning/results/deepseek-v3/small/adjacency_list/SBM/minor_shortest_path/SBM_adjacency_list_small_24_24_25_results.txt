### Explanation:
To find the shortest path between node '24' and '25', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Start at node '24'.
2. From '24', we can go to nodes '23', '26', or '27'.
3. From '23', we can go to '25' directly.
4. From '26', we can go to '25' directly.
5. From '27', we can go to '25' directly.

Thus, the shortest path from '24' to '25' is:  
**24 → 23 → 25**  
or  
**24 → 26 → 25**  
or  
**24 → 27 → 25**

All these paths have a length of **3** (including the start and end nodes). Therefore, the shortest path length is **3**.
