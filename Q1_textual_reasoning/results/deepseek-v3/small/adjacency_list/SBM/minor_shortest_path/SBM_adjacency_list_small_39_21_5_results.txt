To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '21' and '5', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Start from node '21'.
2. Explore all its neighbors.
3. Continue exploring the neighbors of the neighbors until node '5' is found.
4. The number of steps taken to reach node '5' from node '21' is the length of the shortest path.

After performing the BFS, we find that the shortest path from node '21' to node '5' has a length of 4.
