To find the shortest path between node '26' and '25', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the adjacency list provided:

  "3": [0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],

  "7": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9],
  "8": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
  "9": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7],

  "15": [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19],
  "16": [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19],
  "17": [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19],

  "20": [21, 23, 26, 27, 29],

  "23": [20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29],
  "24": [21, 22, 23, 27, 29],
  "25": [21, 23, 27, 28, 29],
  "26": [20, 22, 23, 27, 28, 29],
  "27": [12, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28],
  "28": [11, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29],
  "29": [20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28]
}
```

### BFS Algorithm Steps:
1. Start from node '26'.
2. Explore all its neighbors.
3. If '25' is found among the neighbors, return the path length.
4. If not, continue exploring the neighbors of the neighbors, and so on, until '25' is found.

### Shortest Path:
- **26** -> **23** -> **25**

The shortest path length is 2.
