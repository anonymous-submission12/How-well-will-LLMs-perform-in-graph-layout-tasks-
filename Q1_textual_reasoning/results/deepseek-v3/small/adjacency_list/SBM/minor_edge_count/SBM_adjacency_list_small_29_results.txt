To count the number of edges in the graph, we need to sum up the lengths of all adjacency lists and then divide by 2 (since each edge is counted twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists:
   - 0: 5
   - 1: 3
   - 2: 6
   - 3: 6
   - 4: 8
   - 5: 6
   - 6: 7
   - 7: 6
   - 8: 3
   - 9: 6
   - 10: 5
   - 11: 5
   - 12: 5
   - 13: 7
   - 14: 5
   - 15: 5
   - 16: 7
   - 17: 7
   - 18: 3
   - 19: 5
   - 20: 4
   - 21: 3
   - 22: 3

   Total sum = 5 + 3 + 6 + 6 + 8 + 6 + 7 + 6 + 3 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 7 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 110

2. Divide the total sum by 2 to get the number of edges:
   - Number of edges = 110 / 2 = 55

Here is the JSON response:
