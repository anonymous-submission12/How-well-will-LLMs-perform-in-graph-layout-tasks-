To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the adjacency list provided. A community in a graph is typically defined as a group of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to nodes outside the group. 

By examining the adjacency list, we can identify distinct groups of nodes that are interconnected but not connected to other groups. Here's the analysis:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 22, 23, 24, 25, 26

These communities are identified based on the connections between nodes within each group and the lack of connections between these groups.

Thus, the graph has **3** distinct communities.
