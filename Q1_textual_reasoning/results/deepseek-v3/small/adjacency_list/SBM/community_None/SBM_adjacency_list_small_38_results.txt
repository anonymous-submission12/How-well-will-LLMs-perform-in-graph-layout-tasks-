To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the adjacency list provided. A community in a graph is typically defined as a group of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the graph. 

By examining the adjacency list, we can identify distinct groups of nodes that are interconnected:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 24
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 23, 29
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 28
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 26
5. **Community 5**: Nodes 20, 21, 22, 23, 24
6. **Community 6**: Nodes 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Note that some nodes (e.g., 6, 23, 24, 26, 28, 29) appear in multiple communities, which suggests overlapping communities. However, for the purpose of counting distinct communities, we consider the primary groupings.

Thus, the graph contains **6 distinct communities**.
