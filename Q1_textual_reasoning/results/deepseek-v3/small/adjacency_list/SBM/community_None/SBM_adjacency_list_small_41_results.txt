To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a graph traversal algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore all the connected components. Each connected component represents a community.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Initialize a set to keep track of visited nodes.
2. Iterate through each node in the graph.
3. If the node hasn't been visited, perform a DFS/BFS to explore all nodes in its connected component.
4. Mark all nodes in the connected component as visited.
5. Increment the community count by 1.
6. Repeat until all nodes have been visited.

Let's apply this to the given graph:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

Explanation:
- The first community includes nodes `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 15}`.
- The second community includes nodes `{6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 20}`.
- The third community includes nodes `{12, 13, 14, 16, 17}`.
- The fourth community includes nodes `{18, 19, 20, 21, 22}`.

Wait, upon closer inspection, node `20` is connected to both the second and fourth communities, which means they are actually part of the same community. Therefore, the correct number of communities is 3.

So, the final answer is:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```
