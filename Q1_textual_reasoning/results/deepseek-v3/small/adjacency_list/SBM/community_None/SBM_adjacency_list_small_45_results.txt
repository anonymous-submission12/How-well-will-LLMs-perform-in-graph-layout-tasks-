To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the adjacency list provided. A community in a graph is typically defined as a group of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the graph. By examining the connections, we can identify distinct communities.

Here's the analysis:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
   - These nodes are densely connected among themselves.
   
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
   - These nodes form another densely connected group.
   
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17
   - These nodes are interconnected and form a separate community.
   
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23
   - These nodes are densely connected and form the fourth community.

Thus, the graph has **4 distinct communities**.
