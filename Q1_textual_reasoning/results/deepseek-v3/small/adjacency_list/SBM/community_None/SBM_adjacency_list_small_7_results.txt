To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the adjacency list provided. A community in a graph is typically defined as a group of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the graph. 

From the adjacency list, we can observe the following communities:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
2. **Community 2**: Nodes {7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}
3. **Community 3**: Nodes {14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}

These communities are identified based on the dense connections within each group and the sparse connections between the groups.
