To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the adjacency list provided. A community in a graph is typically defined as a group of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the graph. 

From the adjacency list, we can observe the following communities:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 19}
2. **Community 2**: Nodes {6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15}
3. **Community 3**: Nodes {12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21}
4. **Community 4**: Nodes {18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 26}
5. **Community 5**: Nodes {23, 24, 25, 26, 27}

Each of these communities is interconnected within themselves and has fewer connections to nodes outside their respective communities.

Thus, the number of communities in the graph is **5**.
