To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the adjacency list provided. A community in a graph is typically a group of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the graph. By examining the connections, we can identify distinct communities.

Hereâ€™s the analysis:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17}` are interconnected.
2. **Community 2**: Nodes `{6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}` are interconnected.
3. **Community 3**: Nodes `{18, 19, 20, 21, 22}` are interconnected.

These three groups of nodes are densely connected within themselves but have fewer connections to nodes outside their group, indicating three distinct communities.
