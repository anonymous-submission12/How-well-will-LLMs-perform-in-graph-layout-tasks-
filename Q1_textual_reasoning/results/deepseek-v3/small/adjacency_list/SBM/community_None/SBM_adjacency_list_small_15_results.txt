To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the adjacency list provided. A community in a graph is typically defined as a group of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the graph. 

From the adjacency list, we can observe that the graph is divided into two main groups:

1. Nodes 0 to 12 are densely connected among themselves.
2. Nodes 13 to 25 are densely connected among themselves.

There is a connection between these two groups through node 16 (which is connected to node 0) and node 25 (which is connected to node 10). However, these connections are relatively sparse compared to the dense connections within each group.

Therefore, we can conclude that there are **2 communities** in this graph.
