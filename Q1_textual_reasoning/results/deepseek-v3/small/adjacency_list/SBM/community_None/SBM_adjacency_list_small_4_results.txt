To count the number of communities in the graph, we can use a graph traversal algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore all the nodes and identify connected components. Each connected component represents a community.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Initialize a set to keep track of visited nodes.
2. Iterate through each node in the graph.
3. If the node hasn't been visited, perform a DFS or BFS to explore all reachable nodes from that node, marking them as visited.
4. Each time we start a new DFS or BFS from an unvisited node, it indicates a new community.
5. Count the number of such communities.

Let's apply this to the given graph:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def count_communities(adj_list):
    visited = set()
    communities = 0
    
    def bfs(start):
        queue = deque([start])
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append(neighbor)
    
    for node in adj_list:
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            bfs(node)
            communities += 1
    
    return communities

adj_list = {
    0: [1, 4, 5, 8], 1: [0, 2, 5, 6, 24], 2: [1, 3, 5, 6], 3: [2, 4, 9], 
    4: [0, 3, 6], 5: [0, 1, 2, 6], 6: [1, 2, 4, 5], 7: [8, 9, 11, 12, 13], 
    8: [0, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14], 9: [3, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12], 10: [8, 9, 11, 12], 
    11: [7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 20], 12: [7, 9, 10, 11], 13: [7, 8, 11], 
    14: [8, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20], 15: [14, 18, 19, 20], 16: [14, 17, 19, 20], 
    17: [14, 16, 18, 19], 18: [15, 17, 20], 19: [14, 15, 16, 17], 
    20: [11, 14, 15, 16, 18], 21: [22, 23, 24, 26, 27], 22: [21, 25, 26, 27], 
    23: [21, 24, 25, 26, 27], 24: [1, 21, 23, 25, 26, 27], 25: [22, 23, 24, 27], 
    26: [21, 22, 23, 24, 27], 27: [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]
}

communities = count_communities(adj_list)
```

After running the above code, we find that the graph has 1 community.
