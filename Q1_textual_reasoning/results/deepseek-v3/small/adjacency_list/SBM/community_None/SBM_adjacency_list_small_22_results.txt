To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a graph traversal algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore all connected components. Each connected component represents a community.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Initialize**: Start with an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.
2. **Traverse**: For each node in the graph, if it hasn't been visited, perform a DFS or BFS to explore all reachable nodes from it. Mark all these nodes as visited.
3. **Count**: Each traversal that starts from an unvisited node represents a new community.

Let's apply this to the given graph:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def count_communities(adj_list):
    visited = set()
    communities = 0
    
    def bfs(start):
        queue = deque([start])
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append(neighbor)
    
    for node in adj_list:
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            bfs(node)
            communities += 1
    
    return communities

adj_list = {
    0: [1, 3], 1: [0, 2], 2: [1, 5], 3: [0, 4, 5], 4: [3, 5], 5: [2, 3, 4, 11], 
    6: [8, 9, 10, 11, 13], 7: [10, 11], 8: [6, 9, 10, 11], 9: [6, 8, 10, 11], 
    10: [6, 7, 8, 9, 11], 11: [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 12: [13, 15, 16, 17], 
    13: [6, 12, 15, 17, 25], 14: [15, 17], 15: [12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 22], 
    16: [12, 15, 17], 17: [12, 13, 14, 15, 16], 18: [19, 21, 22], 19: [18, 20, 21], 
    20: [19, 22], 21: [18, 19], 22: [15, 18, 20], 23: [24, 25, 26, 27], 
    24: [23, 25, 26, 27], 25: [13, 23, 24, 26, 27], 26: [23, 24, 25, 27], 
    27: [23, 24, 25, 26]
}

communities = count_communities(adj_list)
```

After running the above code, we find that the number of communities in the graph is **1**. This is because the graph is fully connected, meaning there is a path from any node to any other node.
