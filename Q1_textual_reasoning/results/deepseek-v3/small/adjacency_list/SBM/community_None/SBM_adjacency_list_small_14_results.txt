To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the adjacency list and identify the connected components. A connected component is a set of nodes where each node is reachable from any other node in the same set, and no node in the set is reachable from any node outside the set.

Let's analyze the graph:

1. **First Community**: Nodes `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` are all interconnected.
2. **Second Community**: Nodes `[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]` are all interconnected.
3. **Third Community**: Nodes `[16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]` are all interconnected.

These three sets of nodes are not connected to each other, so they form three distinct communities.
