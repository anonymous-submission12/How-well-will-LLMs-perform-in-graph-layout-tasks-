To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the adjacency list to identify connected components. A community in this context can be considered as a connected component where all nodes are reachable from each other, but not from nodes in other components.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify Connected Components**: We'll traverse the graph to find all connected components.
2. **Count the Components**: Each connected component represents a community.

Let's analyze the graph:

- Nodes 0 to 6 are all interconnected.
- Nodes 7 to 13 are interconnected.
- Nodes 14 to 19 are interconnected.
- Nodes 20 to 25 are interconnected.

These are the four distinct connected components in the graph.

Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is **4**.
