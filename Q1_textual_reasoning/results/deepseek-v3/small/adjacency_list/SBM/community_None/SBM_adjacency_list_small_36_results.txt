To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the adjacency list to identify disconnected components or communities. A community in this context is a set of nodes that are more densely connected among themselves than with nodes outside the set.

Looking at the adjacency list:

- Nodes 0 through 7 are all interconnected, forming one community.
- Nodes 8 through 15 are interconnected, forming a second community.
- Nodes 16 through 22 are interconnected, forming a third community.

There are no connections between these three groups of nodes, indicating that they are separate communities.

Thus, the graph has **3 communities**.
