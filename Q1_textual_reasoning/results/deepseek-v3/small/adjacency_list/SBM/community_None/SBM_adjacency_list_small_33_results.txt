To count the number of communities in the graph, we can use a graph traversal algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to identify connected components. Each connected component represents a community.

Let's analyze the graph:

1. Nodes 0 to 10 are interconnected, forming one community.
2. Nodes 11 to 20 are interconnected, forming another community.

Thus, there are **2** communities in the graph.
