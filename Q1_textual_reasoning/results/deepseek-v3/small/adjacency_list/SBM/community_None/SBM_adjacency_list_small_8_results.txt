To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the adjacency list provided. A community in a graph is typically defined as a group of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the graph. 

From the adjacency list, we can observe that the graph is divided into three distinct groups of nodes that are densely connected within themselves but have fewer connections to nodes outside their group:

1. Nodes 0-9 are densely connected among themselves.
2. Nodes 10-19 are densely connected among themselves.
3. Nodes 20-28 are densely connected among themselves.

These three groups can be considered as separate communities. Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is 3.
