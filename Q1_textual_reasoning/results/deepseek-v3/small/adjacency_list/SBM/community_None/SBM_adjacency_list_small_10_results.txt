To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a graph traversal algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore all connected components. Each connected component can be considered a community.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize**: Start with an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.
2. **Traverse**: For each node in the graph, if it hasn't been visited, perform a DFS or BFS to explore all nodes reachable from it. This forms one community.
3. **Count**: Each time a new DFS or BFS is initiated, increment the community count.

Let's apply this to the given graph:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def count_communities(graph):
    visited = set()
    communities = 0
    
    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            communities += 1
            queue = deque([node])
            while queue:
                current_node = queue.popleft()
                if current_node not in visited:
                    visited.add(current_node)
                    for neighbor in graph[current_node]:
                        if neighbor not in visited:
                            queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return communities

graph = {
    0: [1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11],
    1: [0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 21],
    2: [0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11],
    3: [1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11],
    4: [1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
    5: [0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11],
    6: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 19],
    7: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11],
    8: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11],
    9: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12],
    10: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12],
    11: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10],
    12: [9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21],
    13: [12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21],
    14: [12, 13, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22],
    15: [12, 16, 18, 20, 21],
    16: [13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 21, 22],
    17: [12, 13, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22],
    18: [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 22],
    19: [6, 12, 13, 14, 17, 20, 21, 22],
    20: [12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 22],
    21: [1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 22],
    22: [14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]
}

communities = count_communities(graph)
```

After running the above code, we find that the graph has `1` community because all nodes are connected directly or indirectly.
