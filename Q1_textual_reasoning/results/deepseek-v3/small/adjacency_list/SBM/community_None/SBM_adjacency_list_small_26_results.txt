To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the adjacency list provided. A community in a graph is typically defined as a group of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the graph. 

From the adjacency list, we can observe that the graph can be divided into three distinct communities based on the connections:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

Each community is densely connected internally, and the connections between communities are minimal or non-existent.

Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is **3**.
