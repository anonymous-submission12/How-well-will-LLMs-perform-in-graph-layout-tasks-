To count the number of communities in the graph, we can use a graph traversal algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to identify connected components. Each connected component represents a community.

Here's the step-by-step process:
1. Initialize a visited set to keep track of visited nodes.
2. Iterate through each node in the graph.
3. If the node hasn't been visited, perform a DFS or BFS starting from that node to explore all reachable nodes, marking them as visited.
4. Each time we start a new DFS or BFS, it indicates a new community.
5. Count the number of such communities.

Let's apply this to the given graph:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def count_communities(adj_list):
    visited = set()
    communities = 0
    
    def bfs(start):
        queue = deque([start])
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append(neighbor)
    
    for node in adj_list:
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            bfs(node)
            communities += 1
    
    return communities

adj_list = {
    0: [1, 2, 3, 5], 1: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2: [0, 1, 3, 5, 6], 3: [0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 22], 
    4: [1, 5, 6], 5: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 21], 6: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 7: [9, 10, 11, 13], 
    8: [9, 13, 17], 9: [7, 8], 10: [7, 12, 13], 11: [7, 12, 13], 12: [10, 11, 13], 
    13: [7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 18], 14: [15, 16, 17, 18, 20], 15: [14, 17, 20], 
    16: [14, 17, 18, 20], 17: [8, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20], 18: [13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21], 
    19: [18], 20: [14, 15, 16, 17, 18], 21: [5, 18, 22, 25, 26, 27], 
    22: [3, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27], 23: [22, 24, 25, 26], 24: [22, 23, 25, 26, 27], 
    25: [21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27], 26: [21, 22, 23, 24, 25], 27: [21, 22, 24, 25]
}

communities = count_communities(adj_list)
```

The graph has 1 community because all nodes are connected directly or indirectly.
