To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since we are not implementing the algorithm here, we can analyze the graph structure manually.

From the adjacency list, we can observe that the graph is divided into two distinct communities:

1. The first community includes nodes 0 through 12, which are densely connected among themselves.
2. The second community includes nodes 13 through 25, which are also densely connected among themselves.

There is a single connection between these two communities via node 5 and node 21, but this does not merge them into a single community due to the overall structure.

Thus, the graph has **2 communities**.
