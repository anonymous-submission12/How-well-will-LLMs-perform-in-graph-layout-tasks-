To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the adjacency list to identify disconnected components or communities. A community in this context refers to a set of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the graph.

Hereâ€™s the analysis:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 16}` are interconnected.
2. **Community 2**: Nodes `{6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}` are interconnected.
3. **Community 3**: Nodes `{12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17}` are interconnected.
4. **Community 4**: Nodes `{18, 19, 20, 21, 22}` are interconnected.
5. **Community 5**: Nodes `{23, 24, 25, 26, 27}` are interconnected.

Node `16` appears in both Community 1 and Community 3, indicating that these communities are connected through this node. However, since we are counting distinct communities based on their internal connections, we consider them as separate communities.

Thus, the graph has **5 communities**.
