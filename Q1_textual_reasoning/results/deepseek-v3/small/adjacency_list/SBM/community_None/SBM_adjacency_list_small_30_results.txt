To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the adjacency list and identify the connected components. A community in this context can be considered as a connected component where nodes are more densely connected within the component than with nodes outside the component.

Here's the analysis:

1. **First Community**: Nodes `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13` are interconnected.
2. **Second Community**: Nodes `14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20` are interconnected.

These two sets of nodes are not connected to each other, indicating they form two distinct communities.
