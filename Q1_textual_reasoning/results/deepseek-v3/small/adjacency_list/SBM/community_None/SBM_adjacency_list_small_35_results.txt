To count the number of communities in the graph, we can use a graph traversal algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to identify connected components. Each connected component can be considered a community.

Here's the step-by-step process:
1. Initialize a visited set to keep track of visited nodes.
2. Iterate through each node in the graph.
3. If the node hasn't been visited, perform a DFS/BFS to explore all reachable nodes from it, marking them as visited.
4. Each time we start a new DFS/BFS, it indicates a new community.

Let's apply this to the given graph:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def count_communities(adj_list):
    visited = set()
    communities = 0
    
    def bfs(start):
        queue = deque([start])
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append(neighbor)
    
    for node in adj_list:
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            bfs(node)
            communities += 1
    
    return communities

adj_list = {
    0: [3, 4, 6, 7], 1: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 17, 18], 2: [1, 3, 5, 6], 3: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 20], 
    4: [0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7], 5: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7], 6: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 7: [0, 1, 4, 5], 
    8: [11, 13], 9: [3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 10: [9, 11, 12, 13, 14], 11: [8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15], 
    12: [9, 10, 11, 13, 14], 13: [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 23], 14: [9, 10, 11, 12], 
    15: [11, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21], 16: [15, 18, 20], 17: [1, 15, 18, 19, 20], 
    18: [1, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21], 19: [15, 17, 18, 20, 21], 20: [3, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 26], 
    21: [15, 18, 19, 20], 22: [23, 25, 26, 27, 28], 23: [13, 22, 24, 25, 28], 
    24: [23, 26, 27, 28], 25: [22, 23, 26, 28], 26: [20, 22, 24, 25, 27], 
    27: [22, 24, 26, 28], 28: [22, 23, 24, 25, 27]
}

communities = count_communities(adj_list)
```

After running the code, we find that the graph has 1 community because all nodes are connected directly or indirectly.
