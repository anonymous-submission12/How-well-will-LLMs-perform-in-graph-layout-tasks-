To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '6' and '2', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented as an adjacency list.
2. **BFS Traversal**: Starting from node '6', we explore all its neighbors level by level until we reach node '2'.
3. **Path Length**: The number of edges traversed to reach node '2' from node '6' is the length of the shortest path.

Let's perform the BFS:

- Start at node '6'.
- From '6', we can go to '5' and '7'.
- From '5', we can go to '4'.
- From '4', we can go to '3'.
- From '3', we can go to '2'.

So, the path is: 6 → 5 → 4 → 3 → 2.

The number of edges traversed is 4.
