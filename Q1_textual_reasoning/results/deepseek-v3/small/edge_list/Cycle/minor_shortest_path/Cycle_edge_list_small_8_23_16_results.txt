To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '23' and '16', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented as an adjacency list.
2. **BFS Traversal**: Starting from node '23', we traverse the graph level by level until we reach node '16'.
3. **Path Length**: The number of edges traversed to reach node '16' from node '23' is the length of the shortest path.

Let's perform the BFS:

- Start at node '23'.
- From '23', we can go to '22' and '24'.
- From '22', we can go to '21'.
- From '21', we can go to '20'.
- From '20', we can go to '19'.
- From '19', we can go to '18'.
- From '18', we can go to '17'.
- From '17', we can go to '16'.

The path is: 23 → 22 → 21 → 20 → 19 → 18 → 17 → 16.

The number of edges traversed is 7.
