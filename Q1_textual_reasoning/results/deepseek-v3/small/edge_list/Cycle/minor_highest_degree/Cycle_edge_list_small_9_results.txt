To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the degree of each node.
2. Iterate through the edge list and increment the degree count for each node involved in an edge.
3. Determine the maximum degree from the dictionary.

Here's the JSON response with the highest degree:

  "answer": 2
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph is a linear chain with nodes connected in a sequence, except for node 0 which is connected to node 1 and node 28.
- Each node in the chain (except node 0 and node 28) has a degree of 2 (connected to the previous and next node).
- Node 0 and node 28 each have a degree of 2.
- Therefore, the highest degree of all nodes in the graph is 2.
