To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the degree of each node.
2. Iterate through the edge list and update the degree count for each node.
3. Determine the maximum degree from the dictionary.

Here's the JSON response with the highest degree:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
```

### Explanation:
- The graph is a cycle where each node is connected to exactly two other nodes (except for node 0, which is connected to nodes 1 and 26).
- Therefore, the highest degree of any node in this graph is 2.
