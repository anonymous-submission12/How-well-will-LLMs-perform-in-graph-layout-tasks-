To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node and then determine the maximum value among these counts.

Here is the edge list provided:
```
[(0, 1), (0, 22), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22)]
```

Let's count the degree of each node:
- Node 0: 2 edges (connected to 1 and 22)
- Node 1: 2 edges (connected to 0 and 2)
- Node 2: 2 edges (connected to 1 and 3)
- Node 3: 2 edges (connected to 2 and 4)
- Node 4: 2 edges (connected to 3 and 5)
- Node 5: 2 edges (connected to 4 and 6)
- Node 6: 2 edges (connected to 5 and 7)
- Node 7: 2 edges (connected to 6 and 8)
- Node 8: 2 edges (connected to 7 and 9)
- Node 9: 2 edges (connected to 8 and 10)
- Node 10: 2 edges (connected to 9 and 11)
- Node 11: 2 edges (connected to 10 and 12)
- Node 12: 2 edges (connected to 11 and 13)
- Node 13: 2 edges (connected to 12 and 14)
- Node 14: 2 edges (connected to 13 and 15)
- Node 15: 2 edges (connected to 14 and 16)
- Node 16: 2 edges (connected to 15 and 17)
- Node 17: 2 edges (connected to 16 and 18)
- Node 18: 2 edges (connected to 17 and 19)
- Node 19: 2 edges (connected to 18 and 20)
- Node 20: 2 edges (connected to 19 and 21)
- Node 21: 2 edges (connected to 20 and 22)
- Node 22: 2 edges (connected to 0 and 21)

All nodes in this graph have a degree of 2. Therefore, the highest degree of all nodes is 2.
