To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node and then find the maximum value among these counts.

Here is the calculation:

1. Initialize a dictionary to store the degree of each node.
2. Iterate through the edge list and update the degree count for each node.
3. Find the maximum degree from the dictionary.

Let's perform the calculation:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Initialize a dictionary to store the degree of each node
degree = defaultdict(int)

# Iterate through the edge list and update the degree count for each node
edges = [(0, 1), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 10), (3, 4), (3, 11), (4, 5), (4, 12), (5, 6), (5, 13), (6, 7), (6, 14), (7, 15), (8, 9), (8, 16), (9, 10), (9, 17), (10, 11), (10, 18), (11, 12), (11, 19), (12, 13), (12, 20), (13, 14), (13, 21), (14, 15), (14, 22), (15, 23), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23)]

for u, v in edges:
    degree[u] += 1
    degree[v] += 1

# Find the maximum degree
max_degree = max(degree.values())

# Output the result as a JSON
result = {"answer": max_degree}
```

The highest degree of all nodes in the graph is `4`.

```json
{"answer": 4}
```
