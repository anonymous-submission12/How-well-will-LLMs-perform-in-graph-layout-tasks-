To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Initialize a dictionary** to keep track of the degree of each node.
2. **Iterate through the edge list** and increment the degree count for each node involved in an edge.
3. **Find the maximum degree** from the dictionary.

Let's implement this:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Initialize a dictionary to store the degree of each node
degree = defaultdict(int)

# Iterate through the edge list and update the degree count
for u, v in [(0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 8), (3, 4), (3, 9), (4, 5), (4, 10), (5, 11), (6, 7), (6, 12), (7, 8), (7, 13), (8, 9), (8, 14), (9, 10), (9, 15), (10, 11), (10, 16), (11, 17), (12, 13), (12, 18), (13, 14), (13, 19), (14, 15), (14, 20), (15, 16), (15, 21), (16, 17), (16, 22), (17, 23), (18, 19), (18, 24), (19, 20), (19, 25), (20, 21), (20, 26), (21, 22), (21, 27), (22, 23), (22, 28), (23, 29), (24, 25), (25, 26), (26, 27), (27, 28), (28, 29)]:
    degree[u] += 1
    degree[v] += 1

# Find the maximum degree
max_degree = max(degree.values())

# Output the result as a JSON
result = {"answer": max_degree}
```

The highest degree of all nodes in the graph is **4**.

```json
{"answer": 4}
```
