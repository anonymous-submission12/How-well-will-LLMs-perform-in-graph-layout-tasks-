To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '2' and '15', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Start from node '2'.
2. Explore all its neighbors, then the neighbors of those neighbors, and so on, until we reach node '15'.
3. Count the number of edges traversed to reach node '15'.

From the given edge list, the shortest path from node '2' to '15' is:
- 2 → 1 → 15

This path involves 2 edges.
