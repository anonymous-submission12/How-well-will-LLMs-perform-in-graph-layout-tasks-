To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the nodes. Communities are typically defined as groups of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the graph. By examining the edge list, we can identify distinct groups of nodes that are interconnected.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify connected components**: We can start by identifying groups of nodes that are connected to each other directly or indirectly.
2. **Count the communities**: Each connected component can be considered a community.

Let's analyze the edge list:

- Nodes 0 to 6, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17 are interconnected.
- Nodes 7 to 9, 13, 18 are interconnected.
- Nodes 14, 16, 19, 20 are interconnected.
- Nodes 21 to 26 are interconnected.

From this analysis, we can see that there are **4 distinct communities** in the graph.
