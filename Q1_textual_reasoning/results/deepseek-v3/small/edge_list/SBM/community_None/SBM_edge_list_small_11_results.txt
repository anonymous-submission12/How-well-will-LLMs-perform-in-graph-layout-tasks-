To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the nodes. A community in a graph is typically defined as a set of nodes that are more densely connected among themselves than with the rest of the graph.

From the provided edge list, we can observe that the graph is divided into two distinct sets of nodes that are not connected to each other:

1. Nodes 0 through 11 are interconnected.
2. Nodes 12 through 23 are interconnected.

There are no edges connecting any node from the first set (0-11) to any node in the second set (12-23). Therefore, the graph has two distinct communities.
