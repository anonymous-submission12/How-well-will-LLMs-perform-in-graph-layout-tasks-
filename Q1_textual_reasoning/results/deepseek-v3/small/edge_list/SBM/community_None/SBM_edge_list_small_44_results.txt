To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the graph. Communities are typically defined as groups of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the graph. By examining the edge list, we can identify distinct groups of nodes that are connected to each other but not to nodes outside their group.

Here's the analysis:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 19, 21, 23]` are interconnected.
2. **Community 2**: Nodes `[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 20]` are interconnected.
3. **Community 3**: Nodes `[15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]` are interconnected.
4. **Community 4**: Nodes `[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]` are interconnected.

Note that node `13` and node `19` appear in both Community 1 and Community 2, and node `20` appears in both Community 2 and Community 3. However, these nodes act as bridges between communities rather than being part of a single community. Therefore, we consider them as separate communities.
