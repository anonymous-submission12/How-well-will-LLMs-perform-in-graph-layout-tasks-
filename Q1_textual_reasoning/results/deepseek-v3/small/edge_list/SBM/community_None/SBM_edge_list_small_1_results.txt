To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the nodes. A community in a graph is typically defined as a set of nodes that are more densely connected among themselves than with the rest of the graph. 

Let's break down the graph into its connected components:

1. **First Community**: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 14, 15, 17
   - These nodes are interconnected through various edges.
   
2. **Second Community**: Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
   - These nodes form another interconnected group.
   
3. **Third Community**: Nodes 16, 18, 19, 20
   - These nodes are interconnected and separate from the other communities.

Thus, the graph has three distinct communities.
