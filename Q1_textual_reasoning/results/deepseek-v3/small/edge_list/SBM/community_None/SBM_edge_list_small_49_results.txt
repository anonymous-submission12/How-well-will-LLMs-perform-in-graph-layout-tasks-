To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the nodes. A community in a graph is typically defined as a set of nodes that are more densely connected among themselves than with the rest of the graph.

From the provided edge list, we can observe that the graph is divided into two distinct sets of nodes:

1. Nodes 0 to 13 are densely connected among themselves.
2. Nodes 14 to 26 are densely connected among themselves.

There is only one edge connecting these two sets: (11, 22). This single connection is not sufficient to merge these two sets into a single community, as the connectivity within each set is much denser than the connectivity between the sets.

Therefore, the graph has two communities.
