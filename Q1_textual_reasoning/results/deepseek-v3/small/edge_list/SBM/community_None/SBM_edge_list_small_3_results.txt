To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the nodes. A community in a graph is typically defined as a set of nodes that are more densely connected among themselves than with the rest of the graph. 

From the provided edge list, we can observe that the graph can be divided into three distinct communities based on the connectivity of the nodes:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 22, 24
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 25

These communities are identified by the fact that nodes within each community are connected to each other but not to nodes in the other communities.
