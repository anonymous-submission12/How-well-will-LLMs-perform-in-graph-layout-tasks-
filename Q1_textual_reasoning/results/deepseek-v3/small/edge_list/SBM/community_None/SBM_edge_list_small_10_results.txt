To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since we are not running actual code here, we can analyze the graph structure manually.

From the edge list provided, we can observe that the graph is densely connected, but there are some nodes that seem to form distinct clusters. For example, nodes 0-11 are heavily interconnected, and nodes 12-22 form another densely connected cluster. 

Given this observation, it appears that the graph has **2 communities**.
