To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the graph. A community in a graph is typically defined as a set of nodes that are more densely connected among themselves than with the rest of the graph. In this case, we can identify communities by finding connected components in the graph.

Let's analyze the provided edge list:

1. **First Community**: Nodes 0 through 10 and 18, 20 are interconnected.
2. **Second Community**: Nodes 11 through 20 are interconnected.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that node 18 and 20 are shared between the two communities, which suggests that there is actually only one large community in the graph.

Thus, the graph consists of a single community.
