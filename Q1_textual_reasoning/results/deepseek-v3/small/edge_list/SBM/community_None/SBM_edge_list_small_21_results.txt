To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the nodes. A community in a graph is typically defined as a set of nodes that are more densely connected among themselves than with the rest of the graph.

From the provided edge list, we can observe that the graph is divided into three distinct sets of nodes that are interconnected within themselves but have no connections to nodes outside their respective sets:

1. **First Community**: Nodes 0 through 9 and 26.
2. **Second Community**: Nodes 10 through 19 and 24.
3. **Third Community**: Nodes 20 through 29.

Each of these sets forms a separate community because there are no edges connecting nodes from one set to another. Therefore, the graph has three communities.
