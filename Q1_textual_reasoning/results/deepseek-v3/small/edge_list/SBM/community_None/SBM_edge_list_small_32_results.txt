To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the nodes. A community in a graph is typically defined as a set of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the graph. 

Let's analyze the provided edge list:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 15, 21, 24}
   - These nodes are interconnected through edges like (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (2,15), (3,24), (0,21).

2. **Community 2**: Nodes {6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}
   - These nodes are interconnected through edges like (6,7), (6,8), (7,8), (8,9), (9,10), (10,11).

3. **Community 3**: Nodes {12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 26}
   - These nodes are interconnected through edges like (12,14), (12,15), (13,15), (14,26), (15,16), (15,18).

4. **Community 4**: Nodes {17, 18, 19, 20, 21}
   - These nodes are interconnected through edges like (17,18), (17,19), (18,20), (19,20), (20,21).

5. **Community 5**: Nodes {22, 23, 24, 25, 26}
   - These nodes are interconnected through edges like (22,24), (22,25), (23,24), (24,25), (25,26).

From this analysis, we can see that there are **5 distinct communities** in the graph.
