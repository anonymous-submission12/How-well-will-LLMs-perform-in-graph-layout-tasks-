To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the graph. A community in a graph is typically defined as a set of nodes that are more densely connected among themselves than with the rest of the graph. 

Let's break down the graph into its connected components, which can be considered as communities:

1. **First Community**: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 22
2. **Second Community**: Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
3. **Third Community**: Nodes 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23

Each of these sets of nodes forms a connected component where there is a path between any two nodes within the same set, and no path between nodes of different sets.

Thus, the graph has **3 communities**.
