To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the nodes. A community in a graph is typically defined as a group of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the graph. 

From the provided edge list, we can observe that the graph is divided into two distinct communities:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0 through 12 are densely connected among themselves.
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 13 through 25 are densely connected among themselves.

There are no edges connecting nodes from Community 1 to Community 2, indicating that these two groups are separate communities.

Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is **2**.
