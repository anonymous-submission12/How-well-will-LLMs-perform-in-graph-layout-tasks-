To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since the graph is relatively small, we can manually inspect the edge list to identify communities.

From the edge list, it appears that the graph is divided into two main communities:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0 through 12, 21, and 23.
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 13 through 25.

These two communities are connected through a few edges, such as (5, 21) and (10, 23), but the majority of the edges are within each community.

Thus, the number of communities in the graph is **2**.
