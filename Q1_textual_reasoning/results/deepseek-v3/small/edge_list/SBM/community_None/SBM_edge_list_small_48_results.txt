To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the nodes. A community in a graph is typically defined as a group of nodes that are more densely connected among themselves than with the rest of the graph. 

From the provided edge list, we can observe that the graph is divided into two distinct communities:

1. The first community includes nodes from `0` to `12`.
2. The second community includes nodes from `13` to `25`.

These two communities are connected through the edge `(4, 20)`, which links node `4` from the first community to node `20` from the second community. However, despite this single connection, the two groups of nodes are densely connected within themselves and sparsely connected to each other, which is characteristic of separate communities.

Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is 2.
