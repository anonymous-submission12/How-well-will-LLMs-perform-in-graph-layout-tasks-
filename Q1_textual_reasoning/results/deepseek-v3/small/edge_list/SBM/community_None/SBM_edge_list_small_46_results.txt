To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connected components. A community in this context can be considered as a connected component where all nodes are reachable from each other.

Let's break down the graph:

1. **First Community**: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 17, 19 are all connected directly or indirectly.
2. **Second Community**: Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 are all connected directly or indirectly.
3. **Third Community**: Nodes 13, 14, 15, 16 are all connected directly or indirectly.
4. **Fourth Community**: Nodes 18, 20, 21, 22 are all connected directly or indirectly.

Thus, the graph has 4 distinct communities.
