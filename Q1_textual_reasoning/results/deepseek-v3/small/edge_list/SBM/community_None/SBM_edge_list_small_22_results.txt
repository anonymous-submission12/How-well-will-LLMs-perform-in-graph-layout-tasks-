To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the graph. Communities are typically defined as groups of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the graph. 

By examining the edge list, we can identify distinct connected components, which can be considered as communities if they are not connected to each other.

Here is the analysis:

1. **First Community**: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11
2. **Second Community**: Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13
3. **Third Community**: Nodes 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 22, 25
4. **Fourth Community**: Nodes 18, 19, 20, 21, 22
5. **Fifth Community**: Nodes 23, 24, 25, 26, 27

Each of these groups is a separate community because they are not connected to each other directly or indirectly through any edges.

Thus, the number of communities in the graph is **5**.
