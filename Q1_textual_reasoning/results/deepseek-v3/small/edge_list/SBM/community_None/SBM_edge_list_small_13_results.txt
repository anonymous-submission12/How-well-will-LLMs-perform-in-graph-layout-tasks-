To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the nodes. A community in a graph is typically defined as a set of nodes that are more densely connected among themselves than with the rest of the graph. 

From the provided edge list, we can observe that the graph is divided into three distinct sets of nodes that are densely connected within themselves but have fewer connections to nodes outside their set:

1. Nodes 0 through 9 and 21 are densely connected.
2. Nodes 10 through 19 and 28 are densely connected.
3. Nodes 20 through 29 are densely connected.

Each of these sets forms a community. Therefore, the graph has three communities.
