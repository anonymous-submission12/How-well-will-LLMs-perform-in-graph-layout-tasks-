To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the nodes. A community in a graph is typically defined as a set of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the graph. 

Let's break down the graph:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 17
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

From the edge list, we can see that these three sets of nodes are more densely connected within their respective groups than with nodes outside their groups. Therefore, the graph has three communities.
