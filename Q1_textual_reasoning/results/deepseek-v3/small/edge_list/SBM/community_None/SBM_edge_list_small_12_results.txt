To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the nodes. A community is typically defined as a group of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the graph.

From the provided edge list, we can observe that the graph is divided into two distinct sets of nodes:

1. Nodes 0 to 12 are interconnected.
2. Nodes 13 to 25 are interconnected.

There is only one edge connecting these two sets: (4, 24). This suggests that the graph has two main communities.
