To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the graph. A community in a graph is typically defined as a set of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the graph. 

From the provided edge list, we can observe that the graph is divided into three distinct communities based on the connectivity of the nodes:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 15, 19, 21
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 16, 17, 18, 20, 22

These communities are identified by the fact that nodes within each community are densely connected to each other, but there are few or no connections between nodes of different communities.

Thus, the number of communities in the graph is **3**.
