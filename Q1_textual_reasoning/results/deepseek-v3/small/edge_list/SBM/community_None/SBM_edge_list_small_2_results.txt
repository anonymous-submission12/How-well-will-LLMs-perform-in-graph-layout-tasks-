To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the graph. Communities are typically defined as groups of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the graph. 

Let's break down the graph:

1. **First Community**: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 21, 22 are interconnected.
2. **Second Community**: Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 are interconnected.
3. **Third Community**: Nodes 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 are interconnected.
4. **Fourth Community**: Nodes 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 are interconnected.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that nodes 21 and 22 are part of both the first and fourth communities, indicating that these communities are connected. Therefore, the first and fourth communities are actually one larger community.

Thus, the graph has **three distinct communities**.
