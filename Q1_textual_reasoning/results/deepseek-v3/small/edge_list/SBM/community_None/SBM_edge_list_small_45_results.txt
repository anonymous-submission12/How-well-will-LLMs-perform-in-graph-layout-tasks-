To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the graph. A community in a graph is typically defined as a set of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the graph. 

From the provided edge list, we can observe the following:

1. Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are all interconnected.
2. Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 are all interconnected.
3. Nodes 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 22, 23 are all interconnected.
4. Nodes 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 are all interconnected.

However, upon closer inspection, we can see that nodes 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 22, 23 and nodes 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 are interconnected through node 22 and 23, forming a single larger community.

Thus, the graph has three distinct communities:

1. Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2. Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
3. Nodes 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23

Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is 3.
