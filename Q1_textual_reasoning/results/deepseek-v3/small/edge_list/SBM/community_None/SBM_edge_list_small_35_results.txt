To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the graph. Communities are typically defined as groups of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the graph. 

Let's break down the graph:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 26
   - These nodes are interconnected through various edges, forming a densely connected group.

2. **Community 2**: Nodes 8, 11, 13, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28
   - These nodes form another densely connected group, separate from the first community.

3. **Community 3**: Nodes 10, 12, 14
   - These nodes are connected to each other and to some nodes in Community 1, but they form a distinct group.

4. **Community 4**: Node 26
   - Node 26 is connected to nodes in Community 1 and Community 2, but it doesn't form a separate community on its own. It is part of Community 1.

After analyzing the graph, we can conclude that there are **3 distinct communities**.
