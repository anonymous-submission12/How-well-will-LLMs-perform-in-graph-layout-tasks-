To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connected components. A community in this context can be considered as a connected component where all nodes are reachable from each other.

Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. **Identify all unique nodes**:  
   The nodes in the graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

2. **Find connected components**:  
   - **Component 1**: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.  
     These nodes are all connected directly or indirectly through the edges provided.  
   - **Component 2**: Nodes 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.  
     These nodes form a separate connected component.

3. **Count the number of connected components**:  
   There are **2** connected components in the graph.

Thus, the number of communities in the graph is **2**.
