To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the nodes. Communities are typically defined as groups of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the network. By examining the edge list, we can identify distinct groups of nodes that are interconnected.

Here's the analysis:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 24
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27

From this, we can see that there are **3 distinct communities** in the graph.
