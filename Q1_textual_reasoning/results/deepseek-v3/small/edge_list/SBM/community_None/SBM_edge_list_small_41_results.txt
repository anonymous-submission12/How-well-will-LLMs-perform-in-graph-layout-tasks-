To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the graph. Communities are typically defined as groups of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the graph. 

Let's break down the graph into its connected components, which can be considered as communities in this context:

1. **First Community**: Nodes connected to node 0.
   - Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 15

2. **Second Community**: Nodes connected to node 6.
   - Nodes: 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 20

3. **Third Community**: Nodes connected to node 12.
   - Nodes: 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17

4. **Fourth Community**: Nodes connected to node 18.
   - Nodes: 18, 19, 20, 22

5. **Fifth Community**: Node 21 is connected only to node 22.
   - Nodes: 21, 22

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that node 20 is part of both the second and fourth communities, and node 22 is part of both the fourth and fifth communities. This overlap suggests that these communities are interconnected. Therefore, we should consider them as a single community.

After merging the overlapping communities, we have the following distinct communities:

1. **First Community**: Nodes connected to node 0.
   - Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 15

2. **Second Community**: Nodes connected to node 6.
   - Nodes: 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 20, 18, 19, 22, 21

3. **Third Community**: Nodes connected to node 12.
   - Nodes: 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17

Thus, the graph has **3** distinct communities.
