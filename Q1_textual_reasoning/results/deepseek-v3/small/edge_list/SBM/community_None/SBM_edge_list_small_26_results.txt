To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the nodes. A community in a graph is typically defined as a set of nodes that are more densely connected among themselves than with the rest of the graph. 

From the provided edge list, we can observe the following:

1. Nodes 0 to 6, 9, 11, 13, 14, 18, and 19 are interconnected, forming a dense cluster.
2. Nodes 7, 8, 10, 12 are interconnected, forming another dense cluster.
3. Nodes 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 are interconnected, forming yet another dense cluster.

Given this, we can identify three distinct communities in the graph.
