To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connected components. A community in this context can be considered as a connected component where all nodes are reachable from each other, and there are no connections to nodes outside the component.

Let's break down the graph:

1. **Component 1**: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 24
2. **Component 2**: Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
3. **Component 3**: Nodes 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 23
4. **Component 4**: Nodes 19, 20, 21, 22

Each of these components is a separate community because there are no edges connecting nodes from one component to another (except for node 24, which connects Component 1 and Component 2, but since it's part of both, we consider them as separate communities).

Thus, there are **4 communities** in the graph.
