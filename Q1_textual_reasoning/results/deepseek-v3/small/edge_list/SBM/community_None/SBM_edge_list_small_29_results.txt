To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the graph. Communities are typically defined as groups of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the graph. 

Let's break down the graph:

1. **First Community**: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 17, 19 are interconnected.
2. **Second Community**: Nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 are interconnected.
3. **Third Community**: Nodes 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 are interconnected.

From this analysis, we can see that there are **3 distinct communities** in the graph.
