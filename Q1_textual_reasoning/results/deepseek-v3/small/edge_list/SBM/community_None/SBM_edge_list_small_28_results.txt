To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the nodes. A community in a graph is typically defined as a set of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the graph.

From the provided edge list, we can observe that the graph is divided into two distinct communities:

1. The first community includes nodes from `0` to `11`.
2. The second community includes nodes from `12` to `23`.

The only connection between these two communities is the edge `(9, 22)`, which links node `9` from the first community to node `22` from the second community. Despite this single connection, the two sets of nodes are otherwise densely connected within their own groups and sparsely connected to the other group, indicating two distinct communities.

Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is 2.
