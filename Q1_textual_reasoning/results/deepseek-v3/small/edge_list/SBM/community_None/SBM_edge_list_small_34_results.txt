To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the graph. Communities are typically defined as groups of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the graph. In this case, we can identify communities by looking for connected components.

Here's the analysis:

1. **First Community**: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 17 are connected.
2. **Second Community**: Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15 are connected.
3. **Third Community**: Nodes 11, 12, 13, 14, 20 are connected.
4. **Fourth Community**: Nodes 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 are connected.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that node 17 is connected to both the first and fourth communities, and node 20 is connected to both the third and fourth communities. This suggests that these communities are actually interconnected, forming a single larger community.

Therefore, the entire graph is one connected component, meaning there is only one community.
