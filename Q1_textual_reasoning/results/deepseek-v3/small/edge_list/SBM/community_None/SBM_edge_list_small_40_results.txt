To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connected components. A community in this context can be considered as a connected component where all nodes are reachable from each other, and there are no connections to nodes outside this component.

Let's analyze the provided edge list:

1. **First Community**: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21
   - These nodes are interconnected through various edges.
   
2. **Second Community**: Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9
   - These nodes are interconnected but not connected to the first community.
   
3. **Third Community**: Nodes 12, 13
   - These nodes are interconnected but not connected to the other communities.

Thus, the graph has **3** distinct communities.
