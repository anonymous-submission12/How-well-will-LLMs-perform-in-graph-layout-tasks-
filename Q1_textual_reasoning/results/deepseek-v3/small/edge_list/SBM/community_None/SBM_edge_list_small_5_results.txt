To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the graph. A community in a graph is typically defined as a set of nodes that are more densely connected among themselves than with the rest of the graph. 

Given the edge list, we can identify the communities by finding the connected components in the graph. Here's the analysis:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes connected to each other directly or indirectly.
   - Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26

2. **Community 2**: Nodes connected to each other directly or indirectly.
   - Nodes: 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16

These two sets of nodes are not connected to each other, indicating they form separate communities.

Thus, the graph has **2 communities**.
