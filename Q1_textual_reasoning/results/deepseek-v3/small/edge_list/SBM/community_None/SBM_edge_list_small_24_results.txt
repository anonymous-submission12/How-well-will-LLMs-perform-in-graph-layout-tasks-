To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the graph. Communities are typically defined as groups of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the graph. 

Let's break down the graph into its connected components, which can be considered as communities:

1. **First Community**: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 14, 22
2. **Second Community**: Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 26
3. **Third Community**: Nodes 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 25
4. **Fourth Community**: Nodes 18, 19, 20, 21
5. **Fifth Community**: Nodes 23, 24, 27

Each of these groups is internally connected but not connected to the other groups, indicating they form distinct communities.
