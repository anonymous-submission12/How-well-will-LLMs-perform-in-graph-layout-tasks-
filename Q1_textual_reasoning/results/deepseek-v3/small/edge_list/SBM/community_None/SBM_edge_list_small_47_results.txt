To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the graph. Communities are typically defined as groups of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the graph. 

From the provided edge list, we can observe that the graph is divided into three distinct groups of nodes that are interconnected within themselves but have no connections to the other groups:

1. Nodes 0 to 7 and 22 are interconnected.
2. Nodes 8 to 15 and 18 are interconnected.
3. Nodes 16 to 21 are interconnected.

Thus, the graph has three communities.
