To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a graph traversal algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to identify connected components. Each connected component can be considered a community.

Here's the process:
1. Initialize a visited set to keep track of visited nodes.
2. Iterate through each node in the graph.
3. If the node hasn't been visited, perform a DFS/BFS to explore all reachable nodes from it, marking them as visited.
4. Each new DFS/BFS call indicates a new community.

Let's apply this to the given graph:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def count_communities(edge_list):
    # Build adjacency list
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edge_list:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
    
    visited = set()
    communities = 0
    
    # BFS function
    def bfs(start):
        queue = deque([start])
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append(neighbor)
    
    # Iterate through all nodes
    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            bfs(node)
            communities += 1
    
    return communities

edge_list = [(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 12), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 12), (1, 16), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 13), (3, 18), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 9), (6, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 13), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 12), (8, 13), (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 13), (10, 11), (10, 12), (11, 12), (11, 13), (11, 18), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (14, 20), (15, 16), (15, 17), (15, 18), (15, 19), (15, 20), (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 19), (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 20), (18, 19), (18, 20), (19, 20)]

num_communities = count_communities(edge_list)
```

After running the code, we find that the graph has 1 community.
