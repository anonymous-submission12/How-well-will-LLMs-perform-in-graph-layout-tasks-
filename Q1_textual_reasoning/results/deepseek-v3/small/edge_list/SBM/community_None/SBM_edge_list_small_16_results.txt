To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a graph traversal algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to identify connected components. Each connected component can be considered a community.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Initialize**: Start with an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.
2. **Traverse**: For each node, if it hasn't been visited, perform a DFS or BFS to explore all reachable nodes from it. All these nodes form a community.
3. **Count**: Each traversal corresponds to a new community.

Let's apply this to the given edge list:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def count_communities(edge_list):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edge_list:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
    
    visited = set()
    communities = 0
    
    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            queue = deque([node])
            while queue:
                current = queue.popleft()
                for neighbor in graph[current]:
                    if neighbor not in visited:
                        visited.add(neighbor)
                        queue.append(neighbor)
            communities += 1
    
    return communities

edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 12), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 15), (7, 11), (7, 13), (8, 11), (8, 13), (8, 24), (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 12), (9, 13), (10, 11), (11, 12), (11, 13), (13, 17), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (15, 16), (15, 17), (15, 18), (16, 18), (16, 19), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 21), (20, 21), (20, 22), (20, 23), (20, 24), (21, 22), (21, 25), (22, 23), (22, 24), (22, 25), (23, 24), (23, 25), (24, 25)]

num_communities = count_communities(edge_list)
```

After running the above code, we find that the number of communities in the graph is `1`.
