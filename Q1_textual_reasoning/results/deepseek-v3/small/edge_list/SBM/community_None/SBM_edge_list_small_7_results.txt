To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connectivity of the graph. A community in a graph is typically defined as a set of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the graph. 

Let's break down the graph:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 15]` are all connected to each other directly or indirectly.
2. **Community 2**: Nodes `[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]` are all connected to each other directly or indirectly.
3. **Community 3**: Nodes `[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]` are all connected to each other directly or indirectly.

Node `15` is a bridge between Community 1 and Community 3, but it doesn't merge them into a single community because the communities are still distinct in terms of their internal connections.

Thus, the graph has **3 communities**.
