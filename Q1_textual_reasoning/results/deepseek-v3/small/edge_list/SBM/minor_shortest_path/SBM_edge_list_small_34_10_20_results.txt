To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '10' and '20', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph as an adjacency list.
2. **BFS Traversal**: Start from node '10' and explore all its neighbors level by level until node '20' is found.
3. **Path Length**: The number of levels traversed to reach node '20' is the length of the shortest path.

### Adjacency List Representation:
```json
{
  "0": [1, 2, 3],
  "1": [0, 2, 3, 4, 5],
  "2": [0, 1, 3],
  "3": [0, 1, 2, 4, 5],
  "4": [1, 3],
  "5": [1, 3, 17],
  "6": [8, 10, 15],
  "7": [8, 9, 10],
  "8": [6, 7, 9, 10],
  "9": [7, 8, 10],
  "10": [6, 7, 8, 9],
  "11": [12, 13, 15],
  "12": [11, 13, 14],
  "13": [11, 12, 14],
  "14": [12, 13, 15, 20],
  "15": [6, 11, 14],
  "16": [17, 18, 19, 20],
  "17": [5, 16, 18, 19, 20],
  "18": [16, 17, 19, 20],
  "19": [16, 17, 18, 20],
  "20": [14, 16, 17, 18, 19]
}
```

### BFS Traversal:
- Start at node '10'.
- Level 1: Neighbors of '10' are [6, 7, 8, 9].
- Level 2: Neighbors of [6, 7, 8, 9] are [15, 8, 9, 10].
- Level 3: Neighbors of [15] are [6, 11, 14].
- Level 4: Neighbors of [14] are [12, 13, 15, 20].

Node '20' is found at level 4.

### Result:
```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```
