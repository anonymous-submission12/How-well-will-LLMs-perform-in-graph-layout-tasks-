To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '5' and '1', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here is the JSON response with the answer:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```

Explanation: Node '5' is directly connected to node '1' via the edge (5, 1), so the shortest path length is 1.
