To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '14' and '9', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph as an adjacency list.
2. **BFS Initialization**: Start BFS from node '14'.
3. **Exploration**: Explore all neighboring nodes level by level until node '9' is found.
4. **Path Length**: The level at which node '9' is found represents the length of the shortest path.

Let's implement this:

```python
from collections import deque

# Graph representation as an adjacency list
graph = {
    0: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12],
    1: [0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12],
    2: [0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12],
    3: [0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12],
    4: [3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 24],
    5: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 24],
    6: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 17],
    7: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12],
    8: [0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12],
    9: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11],
    10: [0, 3, 5, 6, 8, 12],
    11: [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9],
    12: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10],
    13: [14, 15, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25],
    14: [13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25],
    15: [13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25],
    16: [13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25],
    17: [6, 14, 15, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25],
    18: [14, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25],
    19: [14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25],
    20: [13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25],
    21: [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25],
    22: [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25],
    23: [13, 14, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25],
    24: [4, 5, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25],
    25: [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]
