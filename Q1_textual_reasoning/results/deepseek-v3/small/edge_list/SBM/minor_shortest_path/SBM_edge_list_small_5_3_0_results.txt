To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '3' and node '0', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Start from node '3'.
2. Explore all its neighboring nodes.
3. Continue this process until node '0' is reached.
4. The number of steps taken to reach node '0' is the length of the shortest path.

From the given edge list, we can see that node '3' is directly connected to node '0' via the edge (0, 3). Therefore, the shortest path length is 1.
