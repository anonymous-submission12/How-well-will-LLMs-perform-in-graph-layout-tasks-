### Explanation:
To find the shortest path between node '7' and node '13', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Start at node 7**: From node 7, we can directly reach nodes [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9].
2. **First level of BFS**: Explore nodes [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9]. None of these are node 13.
3. **Second level of BFS**: From these nodes, explore their neighbors. For example:
   - From node 0, we can reach nodes [1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 22].
   - From node 1, we can reach nodes [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 19].
   - From node 2, we can reach nodes [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 24].
   - From node 3, we can reach nodes [0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9].
   - From node 5, we can reach nodes [0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9].
   - From node 6, we can reach nodes [0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9].
   - From node 9, we can reach nodes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
   - None of these are node 13.
4. **Third level of BFS**: Continue exploring neighbors. For example:
   - From node 4, we can reach nodes [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 15].
   - From node 8, we can reach nodes [1, 2, 4, 6, 9].
   - From node 15, we can reach nodes [4, 10, 11, 13, 18].
   - From node 10, we can reach nodes [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].
   - From node 11, we can reach nodes [10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].
   - From node 13, we can reach nodes [10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18].
   - We have now reached node 13.

Thus, the shortest path from node 7 to node 13 has a length of 4.
