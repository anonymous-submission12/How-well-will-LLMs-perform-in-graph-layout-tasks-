To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '15' and '0', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Start from node '15'.
2. Explore all its neighbors.
3. Continue exploring neighbors level by level until node '0' is found.

From the graph data, the path from '15' to '0' is as follows:
- 15 → 2 → 0

This path has a length of 2.
