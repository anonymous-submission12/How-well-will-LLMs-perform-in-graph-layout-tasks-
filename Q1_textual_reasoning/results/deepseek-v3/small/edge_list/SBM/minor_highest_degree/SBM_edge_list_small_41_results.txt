To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node and then find the maximum value among these counts.

Here is the calculation based on the provided edge list:

{
  "answer": 7
}
```

Explanation:
- Node `1` has 5 edges: (0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9).
- Node `2` has 5 edges: (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 15).
- Node `7` has 5 edges: (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11).
- Node `8` has 5 edges: (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 20).
- Node `12` has 5 edges: (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17).
- Node `22` has 5 edges: (18, 22), (19, 22), (20, 22), (21, 22).
- Node `0` has 3 edges: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3).
- Node `3` has 2 edges: (0, 3), (3, 5).
- Node `4` has 3 edges: (1, 4), (2, 4), (4, 5).
- Node `5` has 5 edges: (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5).
- Node `6` has 3 edges: (6, 8), (6, 10), (6, 11).
- Node `9` has 5 edges: (1, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 10), (9, 11).
- Node `10` has 5 edges: (6, 10), (7, 10), (8, 10), (9, 10).
- Node `11` has 3 edges: (6, 11), (7, 11), (9, 11).
- Node `13` has 4 edges: (12, 13), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 17).
- Node `14` has 3 edges: (12, 14), (13, 14), (14, 17).
- Node `15` has 5 edges: (2, 15), (12, 15), (13, 15), (15, 16), (15, 17).
- Node `16` has 2 edges: (12, 16), (15, 16).
- Node `17` has 4 edges: (12, 17), (13, 17), (14, 17), (15, 17).
- Node `18` has 3 edges: (18, 19), (18, 20), (18, 22).
- Node `19` has 3 edges: (18, 19), (19, 20), (19, 22).
- Node `20` has 4 edges: (8, 20), (18, 20), (19, 20), (20, 22).
- Node `21` has 1 edge: (21, 22).

The highest degree among all nodes is `7`, which corresponds to node `1`.
