To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Initialize a dictionary to store the degree of each node.
2. Iterate through the edge list and update the degree count for each node.
3. Determine the maximum degree from the dictionary.

Here's the JSON response with the highest degree:

```json
{
  "answer": 8
}
```

### Explanation:
- Node `6` has the highest degree, with 8 edges connected to it. The edges connected to node `6` are: `(6, 7)`, `(6, 8)`, `(6, 9)`, `(6, 10)`, `(6, 24)`, `(7, 6)`, `(8, 6)`, `(9, 6)`, `(10, 6)`, and `(24, 6)`. However, since the graph is undirected, each edge is counted once, resulting in a degree of 8 for node `6`.
