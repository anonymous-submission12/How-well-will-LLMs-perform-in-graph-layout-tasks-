To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node and then find the maximum value among these counts.

Here is the JSON response with the highest degree:

```json
{
  "answer": 8
}
```

### Explanation:
- The node with the highest degree is node `7`, which is connected to 8 edges: `(7, 8)`, `(7, 9)`, `(7, 11)`, `(7, 12)`, `(7, 13)`, `(8, 9)`, `(8, 10)`, and `(8, 13)`.
- Therefore, the highest degree in the graph is `8`.
