To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node and then find the maximum value among these counts.

Here is the calculation:

1. **Count the degree of each node**:
   - Node 0: 4 edges
   - Node 1: 5 edges
   - Node 2: 6 edges
   - Node 3: 7 edges
   - Node 4: 5 edges
   - Node 5: 8 edges
   - Node 6: 6 edges
   - Node 7: 4 edges
   - Node 8: 4 edges
   - Node 9: 5 edges
   - Node 10: 6 edges
   - Node 11: 6 edges
   - Node 12: 6 edges
   - Node 13: 8 edges
   - Node 14: 5 edges
   - Node 15: 6 edges
   - Node 16: 5 edges
   - Node 17: 4 edges
   - Node 18: 6 edges
   - Node 19: 6 edges
   - Node 20: 7 edges
   - Node 21: 7 edges
   - Node 22: 5 edges
   - Node 23: 6 edges
   - Node 24: 5 edges
   - Node 25: 3 edges
   - Node 26: 1 edge
   - Node 27: 5 edges
   - Node 28: 4 edges

2. **Find the highest degree**:
   The highest degree among all nodes is **8**, which is shared by nodes 5 and 13.

Here is the JSON response:
