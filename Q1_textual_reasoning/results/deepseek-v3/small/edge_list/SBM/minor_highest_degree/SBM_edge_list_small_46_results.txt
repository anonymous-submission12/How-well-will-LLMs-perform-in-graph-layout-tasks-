To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node and then determine the maximum value among these counts.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Initialize a dictionary** to keep track of the degree of each node.
2. **Iterate through the edge list** and update the degree count for each node involved in an edge.
3. **Find the maximum degree** from the dictionary.

Let's apply this process to the given edge list:

```python
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 12), (0, 17), (0, 19), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (4, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 10), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 17), (8, 9), (8, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), (12, 13), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (15, 16), (15, 17), (16, 17), (18, 20), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 21), (20, 21), (21, 22)]

degree = {}

for u, v in edge_list:
    degree[u] = degree.get(u, 0) + 1
    degree[v] = degree.get(v, 0) + 1

max_degree = max(degree.values())
```

The `max_degree` variable now holds the highest degree of all nodes in the graph.
