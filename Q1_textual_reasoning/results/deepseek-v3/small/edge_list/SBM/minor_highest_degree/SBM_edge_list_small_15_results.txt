To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node and then find the maximum value among these counts.

Here is the JSON response with the highest degree:

```json
{
  "answer": 17
}
```

### Explanation:
- Node `0` has 9 edges.
- Node `1` has 11 edges.
- Node `2` has 11 edges.
- Node `3` has 9 edges.
- Node `4` has 11 edges.
- Node `5` has 8 edges.
- Node `6` has 9 edges.
- Node `7` has 6 edges.
- Node `8` has 11 edges.
- Node `9` has 8 edges.
- Node `10` has 10 edges.
- Node `11` has 10 edges.
- Node `12` has 9 edges.
- Node `13` has 9 edges.
- Node `14` has 9 edges.
- Node `15` has 10 edges.
- Node `16` has 12 edges.
- Node `17` has 8 edges.
- Node `18` has 8 edges.
- Node `19` has 8 edges.
- Node `20` has 7 edges.
- Node `21` has 9 edges.
- Node `22` has 9 edges.
- Node `23` has 12 edges.
- Node `24` has 8 edges.
- Node `25` has 11 edges.

The highest degree is **17**, which corresponds to node `16`.
