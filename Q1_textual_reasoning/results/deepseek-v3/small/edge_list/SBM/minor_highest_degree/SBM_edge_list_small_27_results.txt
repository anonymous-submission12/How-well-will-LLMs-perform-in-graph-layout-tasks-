To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node and then determine the maximum value among these counts.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Initialize a dictionary** to keep track of the degree of each node.
2. **Iterate through the edge list** and update the degree count for each node involved in an edge.
3. **Determine the maximum degree** from the dictionary.

Let's implement this:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Initialize a dictionary to store the degree of each node
degree = defaultdict(int)

# Iterate through the edge list and update the degree count
for u, v in [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 16), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 11), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 27), (5, 16), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (9, 10), (9, 11), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 16), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 17), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (15, 16), (15, 17), (16, 17), (16, 19), (18, 19), (18, 21), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 22), (20, 21), (20, 22), (23, 27), (24, 26), (24, 27), (25, 26), (25, 27), (26, 27)]:
    degree[u] += 1
    degree[v] += 1

# Determine the maximum degree
max_degree = max(degree.values())

# Output the result as a JSON
result = {"answer": max_degree}
print(result)
```

After running the code, we find that the highest degree of all nodes in the graph is **7**.

```json
{"answer": 7}
```
