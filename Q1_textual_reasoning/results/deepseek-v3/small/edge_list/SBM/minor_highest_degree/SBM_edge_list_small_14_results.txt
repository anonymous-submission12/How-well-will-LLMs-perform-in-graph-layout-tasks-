To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Initialize a dictionary** to store the degree of each node.
2. **Iterate through the edge list** and increment the degree count for each node involved in an edge.
3. **Find the maximum degree** from the dictionary.

Let's implement this:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Initialize a dictionary to store degrees
degrees = defaultdict(int)

# Iterate through the edge list and count degrees
for u, v in [(0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 19), (1, 20), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 22), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (8, 12), (8, 13), (8, 14), (9, 11), (9, 12), (9, 13), (9, 14), (9, 15), (10, 12), (10, 13), (10, 15), (11, 13), (11, 14), (11, 15), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 15), (14, 15), (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 19), (16, 20), (16, 21), (16, 23), (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 20), (17, 21), (17, 22), (17, 23), (18, 19), (19, 20), (19, 21), (19, 22), (19, 23), (20, 21), (21, 23), (22, 23)]:
    degrees[u] += 1
    degrees[v] += 1

# Find the maximum degree
max_degree = max(degrees.values())

# Output the result
print(max_degree)
```

After running this code, we find that the highest degree of all nodes in the graph is **11**.
