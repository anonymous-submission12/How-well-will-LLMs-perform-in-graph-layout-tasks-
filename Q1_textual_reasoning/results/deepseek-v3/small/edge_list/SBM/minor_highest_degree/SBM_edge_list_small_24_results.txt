To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node and then determine the maximum value among these counts.

Here is the calculation:

1. **Count the degree of each node:**
   - Node 0: 3 edges (connected to 1, 2, 3)
   - Node 1: 5 edges (connected to 0, 3, 4, 5)
   - Node 2: 5 edges (connected to 0, 3, 4, 5)
   - Node 3: 6 edges (connected to 0, 1, 2, 4, 5)
   - Node 4: 6 edges (connected to 1, 2, 3, 5, 22)
   - Node 5: 6 edges (connected to 1, 2, 3, 4, 14)
   - Node 6: 4 edges (connected to 7, 8, 10)
   - Node 7: 6 edges (connected to 6, 8, 9, 10, 11)
   - Node 8: 6 edges (connected to 6, 7, 9, 10, 11)
   - Node 9: 5 edges (connected to 7, 8, 10, 11)
   - Node 10: 6 edges (connected to 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 26)
   - Node 11: 5 edges (connected to 7, 8, 9, 10)
   - Node 12: 4 edges (connected to 13, 16, 17)
   - Node 13: 6 edges (connected to 12, 15, 16, 17, 25)
   - Node 14: 6 edges (connected to 5, 15, 16, 17, 19)
   - Node 15: 5 edges (connected to 13, 14, 16, 17)
   - Node 16: 6 edges (connected to 12, 13, 14, 15, 17)
   - Node 17: 6 edges (connected to 12, 13, 14, 15, 16)
   - Node 18: 5 edges (connected to 19, 20, 21, 22)
   - Node 19: 5 edges (connected to 14, 18, 20, 21)
   - Node 20: 5 edges (connected to 18, 19, 21, 22)
   - Node 21: 5 edges (connected to 18, 19, 20, 22)
   - Node 22: 5 edges (connected to 4, 18, 20, 21)
   - Node 23: 5 edges (connected to 24, 25, 26, 27)
   - Node 24: 4 edges (connected to 23, 26, 27)
   - Node 25: 5 edges (connected to 13, 23, 26, 27)
   - Node 26: 6 edges (connected to 10, 23, 24, 25, 27)
   - Node 27: 5 edges (connected to 23, 24, 25, 26)

2. **Determine the highest degree:**
   The highest degree among all nodes is **6**.

Here is the JSON response:
