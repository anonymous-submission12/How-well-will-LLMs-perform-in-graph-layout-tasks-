The highest degree of all nodes in the graph is 12. This is calculated by counting the number of edges connected to each node and finding the maximum value. In this graph, node 0 has the highest degree with 6 edges, and node 1 also has 6 edges. However, upon recounting, node 0 has 6 edges, node 1 has 6 edges, node 2 has 6 edges, node 3 has 6 edges, node 4 has 4 edges, node 5 has 5 edges, node 6 has 6 edges, node 7 has 6 edges, node 8 has 5 edges, node 9 has 6 edges, node 10 has 6 edges, node 11 has 6 edges, node 12 has 6 edges, node 13 has 6 edges, node 14 has 6 edges, node 15 has 6 edges, node 16 has 6 edges, node 17 has 4 edges, node 18 has 2 edges, node 19 has 4 edges, node 20 has 4 edges, node 21 has 8 edges, and node 22 has 6 edges. Therefore, the highest degree is 8, corresponding to node 21.
