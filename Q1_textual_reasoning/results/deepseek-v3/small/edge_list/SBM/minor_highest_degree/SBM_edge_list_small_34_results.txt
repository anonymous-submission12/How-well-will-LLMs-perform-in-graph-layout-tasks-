To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node and then determine the maximum degree among them.

Here is the calculation:

1. **Count the degree of each node:**
   - Node 0: 3 edges (connected to 1, 2, 3)
   - Node 1: 5 edges (connected to 0, 2, 3, 4, 5)
   - Node 2: 3 edges (connected to 0, 1, 3)
   - Node 3: 5 edges (connected to 0, 1, 2, 4, 5)
   - Node 4: 2 edges (connected to 1, 3)
   - Node 5: 3 edges (connected to 1, 3, 17)
   - Node 6: 3 edges (connected to 8, 10, 15)
   - Node 7: 3 edges (connected to 8, 9, 10)
   - Node 8: 4 edges (connected to 6, 7, 9, 10)
   - Node 9: 3 edges (connected to 7, 8, 10)
   - Node 10: 4 edges (connected to 6, 7, 8, 9)
   - Node 11: 3 edges (connected to 12, 13, 15)
   - Node 12: 3 edges (connected to 11, 13, 14)
   - Node 13: 3 edges (connected to 11, 12, 14)
   - Node 14: 4 edges (connected to 12, 13, 15, 20)
   - Node 15: 3 edges (connected to 6, 11, 14)
   - Node 16: 4 edges (connected to 17, 18, 19, 20)
   - Node 17: 5 edges (connected to 5, 16, 18, 19, 20)
   - Node 18: 4 edges (connected to 16, 17, 19, 20)
   - Node 19: 4 edges (connected to 16, 17, 18, 20)
   - Node 20: 5 edges (connected to 14, 16, 17, 18, 19)

2. **Determine the highest degree:**
   - The highest degree is 5, which is shared by nodes 1, 3, 17, and 20.
