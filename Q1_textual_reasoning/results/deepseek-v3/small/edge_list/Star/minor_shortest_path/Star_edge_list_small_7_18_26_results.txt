Explanation: In the provided graph, node '0' is directly connected to both node '18' and node '26'. Therefore, the shortest path between node '18' and node '26' is through node '0', resulting in a path length of 2 (i.e., 18 → 0 → 26). However, since the question asks for the length of the shortest path, and the path length is typically counted as the number of edges, the answer is 1 (the edge between 18 and 0, and the edge between 0 and 26). But in this specific case, since both nodes are directly connected to node '0', the shortest path length is 1.
