To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '5' and '19' in the given graph, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented as an adjacency list.
2. **BFS Initialization**: Start from node '5' and explore all its neighbors level by level.
3. **Path Length Calculation**: Keep track of the number of edges traversed until node '19' is reached.

Let's implement this:

```python
from collections import deque

# Graph representation as an adjacency list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 74), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26), (26, 27), (27, 28), (28, 29), (29, 30), (30, 31), (31, 32), (32, 33), (33, 34), (34, 35), (35, 36), (36, 37), (37, 38), (38, 39), (39, 40), (40, 41), (41, 42), (42, 43), (43, 44), (44, 45), (45, 46), (46, 47), (47, 48), (48, 49), (49, 50), (50, 51), (51, 52), (52, 53), (53, 54), (54, 55), (55, 56), (56, 57), (57, 58), (58, 59), (59, 60), (60, 61), (61, 62), (62, 63), (63, 64), (64, 65), (65, 66), (66, 67), (67, 68), (68, 69), (69, 70), (70, 71), (71, 72), (72, 73), (73, 74)]

# Create adjacency list
adj_list = {}
for u, v in edge_list:
    if u not in adj_list:
        adj_list[u] = []
    if v not in adj_list:
        adj_list[v] = []
    adj_list[u].append(v)
    adj_list[v].append(u)

# BFS function to find the shortest path
def bfs_shortest_path(adj_list, start, end):
    if start == end:
        return 0
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (node, distance)
    
    while queue:
        node, dist = queue.popleft()
        if node == end:
            return dist
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
    return -1  # If no path exists

# Calculate the shortest path length
start_node = 5
end_node = 19
shortest_path_length = bfs_shortest_path(adj_list, start_node, end_node)

# Output the result
print(shortest_path_length)
```

Running this code will give us the length of the shortest path between node '5' and '19'.

```json
{
  "answer": 14
}
```

The shortest path length between node '5' and '19' is **14**.
