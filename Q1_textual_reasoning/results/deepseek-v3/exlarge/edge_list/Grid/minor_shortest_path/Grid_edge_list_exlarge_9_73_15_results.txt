To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '73' and '15', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

  "answer": 58
}
```

### Explanation:
- The graph provided is a linear chain with additional connections between nodes and their corresponding higher-numbered nodes (e.g., 0 is connected to 1 and 37, 1 is connected to 2 and 38, etc.).
- Starting from node '73', we traverse the graph using BFS until we reach node '15'.
- The shortest path length from '73' to '15' is 58 steps.

This result is based on the structure of the graph and the BFS traversal.
