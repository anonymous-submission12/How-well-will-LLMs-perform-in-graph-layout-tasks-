To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '32' and '12', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

```json
{
  "answer": 20
}
```

### Explanation:
- The graph is a linear chain with additional connections between nodes at the same level (e.g., (0, 39), (1, 40), etc.).
- Starting from node '32', we traverse the graph level by level until we reach node '12'.
- The shortest path length between node '32' and '12' is 20.

This result is based on the assumption that the graph is connected and the provided edge list is accurate.
