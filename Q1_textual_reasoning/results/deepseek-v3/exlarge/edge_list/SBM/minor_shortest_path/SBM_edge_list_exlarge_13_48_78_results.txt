To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '48' and '78', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

  "answer": 4
}
```

### Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '48' to '78' involves the following sequence of nodes: `48 -> 50 -> 79 -> 78`.
- The length of this path is 4, which includes the starting node '48' and the ending node '78'.
