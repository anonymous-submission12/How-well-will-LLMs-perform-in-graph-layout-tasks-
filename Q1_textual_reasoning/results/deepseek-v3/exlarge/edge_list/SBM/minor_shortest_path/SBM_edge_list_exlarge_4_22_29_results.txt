To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '22' and '29' in the given graph, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
```

### Explanation:
- Starting from node '22', we can directly reach node '29' in 2 steps:
  1. From node '22' to node '24' (direct edge).
  2. From node '24' to node '29' (direct edge).

Thus, the shortest path length between node '22' and '29' is **2**.
