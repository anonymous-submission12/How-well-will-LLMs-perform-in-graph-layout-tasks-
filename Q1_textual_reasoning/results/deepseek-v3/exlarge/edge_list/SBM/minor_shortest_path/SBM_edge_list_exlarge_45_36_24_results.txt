To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '36' and '24', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

```json
{
  "answer": 5
}
```

This result indicates that the shortest path from node '36' to node '24' involves traversing 5 edges. The path can be visualized as follows:

1. Start at node '36'.
2. Move to node '35'.
3. Move to node '30'.
4. Move to node '31'.
5. Move to node '29'.
6. Arrive at node '24'.

Thus, the shortest path length is 5.
