To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '74' and '4', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Initialize**: Start from node '74' and explore its neighbors.
2. **Explore**: Move to the next level of neighbors, keeping track of the distance from the starting node.
3. **Check**: If node '4' is found, return the distance.
4. **Repeat**: Continue until node '4' is found or all nodes are explored.

Let's apply this to the given graph:

- Start at node '74'.
- Explore neighbors of '74': ['65', '66', '68', '71', '73', '77'].
- Explore neighbors of these nodes, and so on, until node '4' is found.

After performing the BFS, we find that the shortest path from node '74' to node '4' has a length of **6**.
