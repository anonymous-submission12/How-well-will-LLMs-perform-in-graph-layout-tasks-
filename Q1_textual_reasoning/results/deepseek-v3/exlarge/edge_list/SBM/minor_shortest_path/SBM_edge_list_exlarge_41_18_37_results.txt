To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '18' and '37', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
```

### Explanation:
- Node '18' is directly connected to node '0'.
- Node '0' is directly connected to node '37'.
- Therefore, the shortest path from node '18' to node '37' is through node '0', resulting in a path length of 2.
