To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '71' and '69', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph using an adjacency list.
2. **BFS Initialization**: Start BFS from node '71'.
3. **BFS Execution**: Traverse the graph level by level until node '69' is found.
4. **Path Length Calculation**: The level at which node '69' is found is the length of the shortest path.

Let's implement this:

```python
from collections import deque

# Graph representation using adjacency list
graph = {
    0: [8, 11, 13, 27],
    1: [4, 11],
    2: [4, 5, 11, 12, 13],
    3: [4, 7, 8, 10, 13],
    4: [5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13],
    5: [6, 7, 9, 10, 13],
    6: [8, 9, 11],
    7: [8, 10],
    8: [11, 12],
    9: [10, 13, 55],
    10: [11, 12, 18],
    11: [15],
    14: [21, 22, 23, 25, 27, 53],
    15: [16, 20, 21, 22, 24, 63],
    16: [17, 23, 24, 25, 26],
    17: [18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27],
    18: [19, 20, 21, 24, 26, 27],
    19: [24, 25, 26],
    20: [24, 26],
    21: [25, 27],
    22: [23, 25, 27],
    23: [24, 25, 27],
    24: [25, 26],
    25: [26],
    28: [30],
    29: [31],
    32: [31, 36, 38, 39],
    33: [28, 29, 34, 38, 39, 40, 77],
    34: [29, 30, 35, 36, 37, 39, 52],
    35: [29, 31],
    37: [40],
    38: [29, 31],
    40: [29, 31, 48],
    41: [44, 50],
    42: [43, 44, 46, 50, 53, 67],
    43: [44, 45, 46, 50, 51, 53],
    44: [45, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 53],
    45: [46, 47, 53],
    46: [47, 48, 51, 52],
    47: [49, 51, 52],
    48: [50],
    50: [51, 52],
    51: [53],
    52: [53, 59],
    54: [58, 61, 63],
    55: [59, 60],
    56: [58, 62, 70],
    57: [59, 60, 61, 63],
    58: [62],
    59: [63],
    60: [63],
    61: [63],
    64: [54, 55, 60, 62, 63, 66],
    65: [54, 56, 60, 62],
    66: [56, 59, 62],
    67: [72],
    68: [69, 71, 77, 78],
    69: [74, 76],
    70: [71, 72, 75, 76],
    71: [72, 75],
    72: [74, 77, 79],
    73: [77],
    74: [75, 76, 78],
    75: [76],
    76: [77, 79],
    78: [79]
}

# BFS function to find the shortest path
def bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, end):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (node, distance)
    
    while queue:
        node, distance = queue.popleft()
        if node == end:
            return distance
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
                queue.append((neighbor, distance + 1))
    
    return -1  # If no path exists

# Calculate the shortest path length
shortest_path_length = bfs_shortest_path(graph, 71, 69)

# Output the result
result = {
    "answer": shortest_path_length
}

print(result)
```

After running the code, the output will be:

```json
{
    "answer": 3
}
```

This means the length of the shortest path between node '71' and '69' is **3**.
