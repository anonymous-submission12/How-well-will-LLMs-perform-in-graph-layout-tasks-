To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '58' and '53', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the length of the shortest path:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```

Explanation:
- From the edge list, we can see that there is a direct edge between node '58' and '53'. Therefore, the shortest path length between these two nodes is 1.
