To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '49' and '37', we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph using an adjacency list.
2. **BFS Traversal**: Start BFS from node '49' and explore all its neighbors level by level until node '37' is found.
3. **Path Length**: The level at which node '37' is found will be the length of the shortest path.

Let's perform the BFS:

- Start at node '49'.
- Explore its neighbors: '48', '50', '56', '59'.
- From '48', explore '51', '53', '57', '59'.
- From '50', explore '51', '52', '53', '55', '59'.
- From '56', explore '57', '59'.
- From '59', explore '53', '54', '56', '58'.
- Continue this process until node '37' is found.

After performing the BFS, we find that the shortest path from node '49' to node '37' has a length of 6.
