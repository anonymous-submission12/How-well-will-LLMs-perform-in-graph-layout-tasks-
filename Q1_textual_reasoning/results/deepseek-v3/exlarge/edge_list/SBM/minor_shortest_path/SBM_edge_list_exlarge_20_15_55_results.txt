To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '15' and '55', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

  "answer": 6
}
```

### Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '15' to node '55' involves traversing through the following nodes: `15 -> 17 -> 56 -> 50 -> 52 -> 53 -> 55`.
- The number of edges in this path is 6, so the length of the shortest path is 6.
