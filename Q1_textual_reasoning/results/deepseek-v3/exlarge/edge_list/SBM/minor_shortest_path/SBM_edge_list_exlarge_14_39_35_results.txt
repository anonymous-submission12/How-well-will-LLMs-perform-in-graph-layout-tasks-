To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '39' and '35', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

The shortest path between node '39' and '35' has a length of 2. This means that the path involves traversing two edges to get from node '39' to node '35'. For example, one such path could be: `39 -> 41 -> 35`.
