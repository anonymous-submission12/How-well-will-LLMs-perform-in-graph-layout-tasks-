To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '56' and '1', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

```json
{
  "answer": 5
}
```

This result indicates that the shortest path between node '56' and '1' consists of 5 edges.
