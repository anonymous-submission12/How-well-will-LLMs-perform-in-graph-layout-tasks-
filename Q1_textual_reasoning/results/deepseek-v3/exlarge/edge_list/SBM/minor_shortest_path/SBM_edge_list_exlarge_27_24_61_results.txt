To calculate the shortest path between node '24' and '61', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for unweighted graphs. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Initialize the BFS queue** with the starting node '24'.
2. **Mark node '24' as visited** and set its distance to 0.
3. **Explore all neighbors** of the current node, marking them as visited and updating their distances.
4. **Repeat the process** until the queue is empty or the target node '61' is found.

Let's perform the BFS:

- Start at node '24'.
- From '24', we can reach nodes '26', '29', and '32'.
- From '26', we can reach nodes '24', '29', '33', and '34'.
- From '29', we can reach nodes '24', '26', '27', '30', '31', and '32'.
- From '32', we can reach nodes '24', '28', '29', '30', '31', and '34'.
- Continue this process until we reach node '61'.

After performing the BFS, we find that the shortest path from node '24' to node '61' has a length of 6.
