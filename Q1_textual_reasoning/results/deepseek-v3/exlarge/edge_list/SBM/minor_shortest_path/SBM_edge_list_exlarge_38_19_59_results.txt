To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '19' and '59', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented as an adjacency list where each node points to its neighboring nodes.
2. **BFS Initialization**: Start from node '19' and explore all its neighbors level by level.
3. **Exploration**: Continue exploring until node '59' is found.
4. **Path Length**: The number of levels traversed to reach node '59' is the length of the shortest path.

Let's perform the BFS:

- Start at node '19'.
- From '19', we can go to '11', '14', '15', and '34'.
- From '34', we can go to '33' and '31'.
- From '33', we can go to '30', '34', and '37'.
- From '37', we can go to '35', '36', '38', and '50'.
- From '50', we can go to '51', '53', '54', '55', '57', and '58'.
- From '57', we can go to '1', '52', '54', '58', and '76'.
- From '58', we can go to '52', '55', '56', '57'.
- From '76', we can go to '57', '72', '73', '74', '75'.
- From '72', we can go to '54', '68', '71', '73', '76'.
- From '71', we can go to '25', '70', '72', '73', '74'.
- From '25', we can go to '20', '22', '24', '27', '71'.
- From '27', we can go to '20', '22', '24', '25', '26', '29', '61'.
- From '61', we can go to '27', '49', '59', '62', '66'.
- From '59', we can go to '60', '61', '62', '65', '66'.

The shortest path from '19' to '59' is: `19 -> 34 -> 33 -> 37 -> 50 -> 57 -> 76 -> 72 -> 71 -> 25 -> 27 -> 61 -> 59`.

The length of this path is **12**.
