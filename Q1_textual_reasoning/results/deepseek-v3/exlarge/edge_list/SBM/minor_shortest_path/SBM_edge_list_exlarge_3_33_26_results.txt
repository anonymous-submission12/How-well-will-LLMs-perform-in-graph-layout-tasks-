To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '33' and '26', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

  "answer": 2
}
```

### Explanation:
- The shortest path between node '33' and '26' is found by traversing the graph using BFS.
- The path is: `33 -> 25 -> 26`, which consists of 2 edges.
- Therefore, the length of the shortest path is 2.
