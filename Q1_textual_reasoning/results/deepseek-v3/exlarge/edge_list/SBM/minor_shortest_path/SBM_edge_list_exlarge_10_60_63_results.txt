To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '60' and '63', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```

Explanation:
- From the edge list, we can see that there is a direct edge between node '60' and '63': `(60, 63)`.
- Therefore, the shortest path length between node '60' and '63' is 1.
