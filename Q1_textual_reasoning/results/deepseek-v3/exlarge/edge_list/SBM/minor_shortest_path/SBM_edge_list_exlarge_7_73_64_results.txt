To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '73' and '64', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

  "answer": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '73' to '64' involves the following sequence of nodes: `73 -> 62 -> 71 -> 64`.
- The length of this path is 3 edges.

Thus, the shortest path length between node '73' and '64' is **3**.
