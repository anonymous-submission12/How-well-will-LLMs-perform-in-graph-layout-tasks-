To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '22' and node '41', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the length of the shortest path:

  "answer": 5
}
```

### Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '22' to node '41' involves traversing through the following nodes: `22 -> 16 -> 21 -> 24 -> 59 -> 41`.
- The number of edges in this path is 5, so the length of the shortest path is 5.
