To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '11' and node '66', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

  "answer": 6
}
```

### Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '11' to node '66' involves traversing through the following nodes: `11 -> 15 -> 13 -> 56 -> 46 -> 57 -> 60 -> 66`.
- The number of edges in this path is 6, so the length of the shortest path is 6.
