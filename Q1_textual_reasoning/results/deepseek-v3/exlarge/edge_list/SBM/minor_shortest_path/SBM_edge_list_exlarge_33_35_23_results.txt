To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '35' and '23', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '35' to '23' involves traversing 3 edges. For example:
  - **35 → 2 → 14 → 23**
  - **35 → 4 → 23**
  - **35 → 5 → 23**

Thus, the shortest path length is **3**.
