To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '31' and '46', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

```json

  "answer": 2
}
```

### Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '31' to '46' is through the edges `(31, 46)` or `(31, 47)` and `(47, 46)`.
- The path length is 2, as it involves traversing two edges.

Thus, the shortest path length between node '31' and '46' is **2**.
