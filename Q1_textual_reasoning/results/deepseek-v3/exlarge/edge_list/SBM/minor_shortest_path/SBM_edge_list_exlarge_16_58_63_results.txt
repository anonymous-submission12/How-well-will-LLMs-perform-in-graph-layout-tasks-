To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '58' and '63', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

  "answer": 2
}
```

### Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '58' to '63' involves traversing through node '60'.
- The path is: `58 -> 60 -> 63`.
- Therefore, the length of the shortest path is 2.

This result is derived by analyzing the graph structure and applying the BFS algorithm to find the minimal number of edges between the two nodes.
