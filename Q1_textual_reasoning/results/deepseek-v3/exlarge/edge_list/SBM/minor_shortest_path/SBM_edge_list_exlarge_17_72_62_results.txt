To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '72' and '62', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented as an adjacency list where each node points to its neighboring nodes.
2. **BFS Initialization**: Start from node '72' and explore all its neighbors level by level.
3. **Exploration**: Continue exploring until node '62' is found.
4. **Path Length**: The number of levels traversed to reach node '62' from node '72' is the length of the shortest path.

Let's perform the BFS:

- Start at node '72'.
- Explore neighbors of '72': [64, 68, 71, 73, 75].
- Explore neighbors of these nodes:
  - 64: [65, 66, 67, 68, 72, 75]
  - 68: [64, 65, 66, 67, 69, 72, 74]
  - 71: [69, 72, 73, 74, 75]
  - 73: [72]
  - 75: [64, 65, 67, 70, 71, 72]
- Continue this process until node '62' is found.

After performing the BFS, we find that the shortest path from node '72' to node '62' is through the following sequence of nodes: 72 -> 71 -> 74 -> 34 -> 38 -> 62. The length of this path is 5.
