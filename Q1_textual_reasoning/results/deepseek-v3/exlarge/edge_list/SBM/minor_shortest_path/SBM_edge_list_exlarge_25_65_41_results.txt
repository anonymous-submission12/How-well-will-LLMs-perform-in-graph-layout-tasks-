To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '65' and '41', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

  "answer": 5
}
```

### Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '65' to '41' involves the following sequence of nodes: `65 -> 18 -> 23 -> 22 -> 51 -> 41`.
- The length of this path is 5 edges.

Thus, the shortest path length between node '65' and '41' is **5**.
