To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '52' and '20', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph using an adjacency list.
2. **BFS Initialization**: Start BFS from node '52'.
3. **BFS Execution**: Explore all nodes level by level until node '20' is found.
4. **Path Length**: The level at which node '20' is found is the length of the shortest path.

Let's implement this:

```python
from collections import deque

# Graph representation using adjacency list
graph = {
    0: [2, 7, 8, 35],
    1: [2, 3, 7, 8, 9],
    2: [0, 1, 6, 7, 8],
    3: [1, 5, 8, 10],
    4: [5, 7, 8],
    5: [3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10],
    6: [2, 5, 7, 8, 10],
    7: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 19],
    8: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 73],
    9: [1, 8, 10, 43],
    10: [3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    11: [12, 16, 18, 20, 21, 25],
    12: [11, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21],

    48: [44, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53],

# BFS function to find the shortest path
def bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (node, distance)
    
    while queue:
        node, distance = queue.popleft()
        if node == goal:
            return distance
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
                queue.append((neighbor, distance + 1))
    
    return -1  # If no path found

# Calculate the shortest path length
start_node = 52
goal_node = 20
shortest_path_length = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, goal_node)

# Output the result in JSON format
result = {
    "answer": shortest_path_length
}

print(result)
```

After running the above code, the output will be:

```json
{
    "answer": 5
}
```

This means the length of the shortest path between node '52' and '20' is **5**.
