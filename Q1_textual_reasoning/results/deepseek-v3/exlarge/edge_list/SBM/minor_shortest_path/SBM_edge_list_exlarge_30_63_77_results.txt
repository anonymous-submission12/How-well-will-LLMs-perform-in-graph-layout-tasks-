To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '63' and '77', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

  "answer": 4
}
```

### Explanation:
- The BFS algorithm starts at node '63' and explores all its neighbors level by level.
- It finds that the shortest path from '63' to '77' involves 4 edges, meaning the path length is 4.
