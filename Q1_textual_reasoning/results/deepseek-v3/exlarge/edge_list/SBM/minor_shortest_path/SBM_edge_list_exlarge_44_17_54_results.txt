To calculate the shortest path between node '17' and '54', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph using an adjacency list.
2. **BFS Algorithm**: Use BFS to explore the graph starting from node '17' until we reach node '54'.
3. **Path Length**: The number of steps taken to reach node '54' from node '17' will be the length of the shortest path.

Let's implement this step-by-step.

### Step 1: Graph Representation
We will create an adjacency list from the given edge list.

### Step 2: BFS Algorithm
We will perform BFS starting from node '17' and keep track of the distance from '17' to each node.

### Step 3: Path Length
Once we reach node '54', we will return the distance.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

### Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '17' to node '54' involves 6 edges. The path is: `17 -> 15 -> 18 -> 51 -> 53 -> 54`.

This is the minimum number of steps required to travel from node '17' to node '54' in the given graph.
