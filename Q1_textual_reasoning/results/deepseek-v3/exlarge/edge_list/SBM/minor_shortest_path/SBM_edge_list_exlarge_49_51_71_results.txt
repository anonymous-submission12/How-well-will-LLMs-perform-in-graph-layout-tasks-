To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '51' and '71' in the given graph, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the length of the shortest path:

```json
{
  "answer": 5
}
```

### Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '51' to '71' involves the following sequence of nodes: `51 -> 52 -> 56 -> 33 -> 73 -> 71`.
- The length of this path is 5 edges.

This is the shortest path found using BFS, and the length is 5.
