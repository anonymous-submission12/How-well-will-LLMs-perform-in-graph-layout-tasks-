To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '46' and '20', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

```json
{
  "answer": 6
}
```

This result indicates that the shortest path between node '46' and '20' consists of 6 edges.
