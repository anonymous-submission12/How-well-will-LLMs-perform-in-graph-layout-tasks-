To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '50' and '26', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

  "answer": 5
}
```

### Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '50' to node '26' involves traversing through the following nodes: `50 -> 35 -> 40 -> 28 -> 20 -> 26`.
- The number of edges in this path is 5, so the length of the shortest path is 5.
