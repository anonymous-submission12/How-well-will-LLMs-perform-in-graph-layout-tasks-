To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '19' and '15', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

### Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '19' to '15' can be found by traversing the graph using BFS.
- From node '19', we can directly reach nodes like '3', '4', '6', '7', '10', '11', '13', '14', '17', '20', and '24'.
- From these nodes, node '3' is directly connected to node '15'.
- Therefore, the shortest path is: `19 -> 3 -> 15`, which has a length of 2 edges.

Thus, the length of the shortest path between node '19' and '15' is **2**.
