To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '46' and '25', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

```json
{
  "answer": 5
}
```

### Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '46' to node '25' involves the following sequence of nodes: `46 -> 49 -> 52 -> 20 -> 19 -> 25`.
- The length of this path is 5 edges.

Thus, the shortest path length between node '46' and '25' is **5**.
