To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '23' and '32', we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

```json
{
  "answer": 6
}
```

This result indicates that the shortest path between node '23' and '32' consists of 6 edges. The path can be traced through the nodes as follows: 23 → 19 → 17 → 68 → 64 → 66 → 10 → 32. However, the exact path may vary depending on the specific connections in the graph. The key point is that the shortest path length is 6.
