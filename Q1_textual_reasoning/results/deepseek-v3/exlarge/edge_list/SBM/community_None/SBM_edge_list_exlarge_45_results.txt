To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since we are working with a static edge list, we can also manually inspect the graph to identify communities based on the connectivity of nodes.

From the provided edge list, we can observe that the graph is divided into several distinct groups of nodes that are densely connected within themselves but sparsely connected with other groups. Here is a breakdown of the communities:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-14
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 15-29
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 30-44
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 45-59
5. **Community 5**: Nodes 60-74

Each of these communities is a separate cluster of nodes that are more connected within themselves than with nodes in other communities.
