To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since I cannot execute code directly, I will analyze the graph structure manually by identifying connected components or clusters of nodes that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to other clusters.

After analyzing the graph, it appears that the nodes are grouped into several distinct communities based on their connections. Here is the JSON response with the number of communities:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

This answer is based on the observation that the graph can be divided into 4 main communities where nodes within each community are more densely connected to each other than to nodes in other communities.
