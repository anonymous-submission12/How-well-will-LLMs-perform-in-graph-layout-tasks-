To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since we are not running actual code here, we will analyze the graph structure manually.

From the edge list provided, we can observe that the graph is divided into several connected components, which can be considered as communities. Here is a breakdown of the communities based on the connections:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12, 34, 47
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 1, 3, 5, 9, 10, 47
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 6, 7, 8
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 11, 14, 17, 20
5. **Community 5**: Nodes 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21
6. **Community 6**: Nodes 13, 15, 19, 20
7. **Community 7**: Nodes 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 30, 31, 32, 35
8. **Community 8**: Nodes 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 58
9. **Community 9**: Nodes 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 62, 70
10. **Community 10**: Nodes 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62
11. **Community 11**: Nodes 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72

Based on this analysis, there are **11 communities** in the graph.
