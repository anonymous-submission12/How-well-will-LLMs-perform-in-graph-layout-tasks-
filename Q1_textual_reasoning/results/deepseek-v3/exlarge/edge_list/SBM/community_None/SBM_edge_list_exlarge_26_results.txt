To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since I cannot execute code directly, I will analyze the graph structure manually to identify communities based on the connectivity of nodes.

After analyzing the graph, it appears that the nodes are grouped into several distinct communities based on their connections. Here is the JSON response with the number of communities identified:

```json
{
  "answer": 6
}
```

This answer is based on the observation that the graph can be divided into 6 distinct communities based on the connectivity patterns in the provided edge list.
