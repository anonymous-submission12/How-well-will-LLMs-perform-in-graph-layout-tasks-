To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since we are working with a static edge list, we can use a simpler approach by identifying connected components in the graph.

A connected component is a set of nodes where each node is reachable from any other node in the set, and there are no connections to nodes outside the set. Each connected component can be considered a community.

Let's analyze the provided edge list to identify the connected components:

1. **First Community (Nodes 0-25, 42, 46, 50, 59, 60, 65, 69, 72, 75):**
   - This community includes nodes that are densely connected among themselves, with some connections to nodes outside this range (e.g., 42, 46, 50, etc.).

2. **Second Community (Nodes 26-50, 68, 71, 73, 74, 75):**
   - This community includes nodes that are connected among themselves, with some connections to nodes outside this range (e.g., 68, 71, etc.).

3. **Third Community (Nodes 51-75):**
   - This community includes nodes that are connected among themselves, with some connections to nodes outside this range (e.g., 75).

After analyzing the edge list, we can see that the graph has **3 distinct communities**.
