To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since we are not running actual code here, we can analyze the graph structure manually by identifying disconnected components or clusters of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the graph.

From the provided edge list, we can observe that the graph is divided into several distinct clusters of nodes that are interconnected but not connected to other clusters. Here is a rough breakdown:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-14, 25, 38, 43, 48, 67, 73
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 15-29, 54, 68
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 30-44, 56, 58
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 45-59, 72
5. **Community 5**: Nodes 60-74

These communities are identified based on the dense connections within each group and the lack of connections between groups.
