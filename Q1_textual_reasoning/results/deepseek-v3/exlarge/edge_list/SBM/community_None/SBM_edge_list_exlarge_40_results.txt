To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since the graph is provided as an edge list, we can also analyze the connectivity of the graph to identify communities.

Given the edge list, we can observe that the graph is divided into two distinct sets of nodes that are not connected to each other. The first set of nodes ranges from 0 to 38, and the second set ranges from 39 to 76. There are no edges connecting nodes from the first set to the second set, indicating that the graph has two separate communities.

Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is 2.
