To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since we are not running actual code here, we can analyze the graph structure manually by looking for densely connected subgraphs that are sparsely connected to other subgraphs.

From the provided edge list, we can observe that the graph has several clusters of nodes that are densely connected among themselves but have fewer connections to nodes outside their cluster. For example:

1. Nodes 0-19 form a densely connected cluster.
2. Nodes 20-39 form another densely connected cluster.
3. Nodes 40-58 form another cluster.
4. Nodes 59-77 form yet another cluster.

These clusters are relatively well-separated, with only a few edges connecting them. Therefore, we can infer that there are **4 communities** in the graph.
