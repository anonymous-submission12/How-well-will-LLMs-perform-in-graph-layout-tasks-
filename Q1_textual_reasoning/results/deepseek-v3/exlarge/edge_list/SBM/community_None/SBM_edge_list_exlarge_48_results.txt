To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since the graph is provided as an edge list, we can also analyze the connectivity of the graph to identify communities.

Upon analyzing the edge list, it appears that the graph is divided into two main communities:

1. The first community consists of nodes 0 to 25, 44, 46, 52, 57, 72, 76, and 77.
2. The second community consists of nodes 26 to 51, 53 to 56, 58 to 71, 73 to 75.

These two communities are connected through node 26, which acts as a bridge between the two communities.

Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is 2.
