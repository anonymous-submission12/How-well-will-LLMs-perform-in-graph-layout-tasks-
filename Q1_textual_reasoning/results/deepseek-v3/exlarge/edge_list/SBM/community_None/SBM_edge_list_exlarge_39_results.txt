To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since I cannot directly execute code, I will analyze the graph structure manually to identify communities.

From the edge list provided, it appears that the graph has several distinct clusters of nodes that are more densely connected within themselves than with the rest of the graph. Here is a rough breakdown of the communities:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-27 (excluding some nodes that are part of other communities)
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 28-40, 77
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 41-53, 67
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 54-66
5. **Community 5**: Nodes 68-79

This gives us a total of 5 communities.
