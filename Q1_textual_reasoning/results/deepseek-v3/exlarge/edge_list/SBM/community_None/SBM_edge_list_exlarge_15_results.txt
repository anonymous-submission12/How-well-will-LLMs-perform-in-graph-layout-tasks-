To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since we are working with a static edge list, we can manually inspect the graph to identify communities based on the connectivity of nodes.

After analyzing the edge list, we can observe that the graph is divided into several distinct communities where nodes within a community are densely connected, and connections between communities are sparse. Here is the breakdown of the communities:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 53, 61
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 37, 38, 42, 55, 62
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 42, 57
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56
5. **Community 5**: Nodes 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 71
6. **Community 6**: Nodes 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78

Based on this analysis, the graph has **6 communities**.
