To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since the graph is provided as an edge list, we can also analyze the connectivity of the graph to identify communities.

From the edge list, we can observe that the graph is divided into two distinct sets of nodes that are not connected to each other:

1. Nodes 0 to 36 are interconnected.
2. Nodes 37 to 73 are interconnected.

There are no edges connecting any node from the first set (0-36) to any node in the second set (37-73). Therefore, the graph has two distinct communities.
