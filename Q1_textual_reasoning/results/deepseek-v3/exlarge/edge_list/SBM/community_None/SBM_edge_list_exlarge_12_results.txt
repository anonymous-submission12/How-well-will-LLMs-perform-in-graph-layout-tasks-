To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since I cannot execute code directly, I will analyze the graph structure manually by identifying connected components or clusters of nodes that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to other clusters.

From the provided edge list, I can observe that the graph is divided into several distinct clusters of nodes that are interconnected. Here is a breakdown of the communities:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-12, 46, 77
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 13-25, 33
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 26-38, 56
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 39-52, 54, 57, 58, 61, 63
5. **Community 5**: Nodes 53, 55, 59, 60, 62, 64
6. **Community 6**: Nodes 65-77

Based on this analysis, the graph appears to have **6 communities**.
