To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since we are working with a static edge list, we can use a simpler approach by identifying connected components in the graph.

A connected component is a set of nodes where each node is reachable from every other node in the set, and no node in the set is reachable from any node outside the set. Each connected component can be considered a community.

Let's analyze the graph:

1. **First Community**: Nodes 0-12 are interconnected.
2. **Second Community**: Nodes 13-25 are interconnected.
3. **Third Community**: Nodes 26-38 are interconnected.
4. **Fourth Community**: Nodes 39-51 are interconnected.
5. **Fifth Community**: Nodes 52-64 are interconnected.
6. **Sixth Community**: Nodes 65-75 are interconnected.

From this analysis, we can see that there are 6 distinct communities in the graph.
