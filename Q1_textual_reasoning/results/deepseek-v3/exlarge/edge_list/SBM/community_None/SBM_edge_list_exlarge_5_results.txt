To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since we are working with a static edge list, we can manually inspect the graph to identify disconnected components, which can be considered as separate communities.

Upon inspecting the edge list, we can see that the graph is connected, meaning there are no disconnected components. Therefore, the entire graph forms a single community.
