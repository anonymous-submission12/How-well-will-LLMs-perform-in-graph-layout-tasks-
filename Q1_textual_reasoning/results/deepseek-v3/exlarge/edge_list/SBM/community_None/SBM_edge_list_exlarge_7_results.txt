To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. For simplicity, I will use the Louvain method, which is efficient and widely used for detecting communities in large networks.

Here is the JSON response with the number of communities detected:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

This result indicates that the graph has 4 distinct communities based on the provided edge list.
