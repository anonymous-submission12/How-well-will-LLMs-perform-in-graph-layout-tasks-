To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since I cannot execute code directly, I will analyze the graph structure manually by identifying connected components, which can often correspond to communities in a graph with a clear community structure.

Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. **Identify connected components**:
   - Nodes 0-14, 46, 54, 61, 63, 66, 71 are connected.
   - Nodes 15-29, 67-69 are connected.
   - Nodes 30-43, 49, 53, 54, 63 are connected.
   - Nodes 44-57 are connected.
   - Nodes 58-59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 70-71 are connected.
   - Nodes 64, 66, 68, 69, 70, 71 are connected.

2. **Merge overlapping components**:
   - The first component (0-14, 46, 54, 61, 63, 66, 71) overlaps with the third component (30-43, 49, 53, 54, 63) through node 54 and 63.
   - The second component (15-29, 67-69) overlaps with the fifth component (58-59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 70-71) through node 67 and 69.
   - The fourth component (44-57) overlaps with the first component through node 54.
   - The sixth component (64, 66, 68, 69, 70, 71) overlaps with the first component through node 66 and 71, and with the fifth component through node 69 and 71.

3. **Final communities**:
   - After merging, the graph appears to have **3 distinct communities**:
     - One community centered around nodes 0-14, 30-43, 44-57, 61, 63, 66, 71.
     - Another community centered around nodes 15-29, 58-59, 65, 67-71.
     - A third community centered around nodes 64, 66, 68, 69, 70, 71.

Thus, the number of communities in the graph is **3**.
