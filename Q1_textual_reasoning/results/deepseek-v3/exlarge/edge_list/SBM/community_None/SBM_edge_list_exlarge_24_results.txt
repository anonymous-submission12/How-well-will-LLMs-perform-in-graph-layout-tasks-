To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since we are only provided with the edge list and no additional information about the communities, we will need to infer the communities based on the connectivity of the graph.

Given the edge list, we can observe that the graph is divided into several connected components, each of which can be considered a community. By analyzing the connections, we can identify these communities.

After analyzing the edge list, it appears that the graph is divided into **3 distinct communities**.
