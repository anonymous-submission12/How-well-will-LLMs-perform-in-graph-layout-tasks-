To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since I cannot run code directly, I will analyze the graph structure manually based on the edge list provided.

From the edge list, it appears that the graph has two distinct communities:

1. The first community consists of nodes 0 to 25, 38, 51, 52, 53, 54, 73, and 74. These nodes are densely connected among themselves.
2. The second community consists of nodes 26 to 37, 39 to 50, 55 to 72, 75, 76, and 77. These nodes are also densely connected among themselves.

There are a few nodes that seem to bridge these communities, such as node 25, which is connected to node 38, and node 54, which is connected to node 53. However, these connections are relatively sparse compared to the dense connections within each community.

Based on this analysis, the graph has **2 communities**.
