To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since we are not running actual code here, we can infer the number of communities by analyzing the connectivity of the graph.

From the provided edge list, we can observe that the graph is divided into several distinct clusters of nodes that are densely connected within themselves but sparsely connected to other clusters. By examining the connections, we can identify the following communities:

1. Nodes 0-25 form a densely connected cluster.
2. Nodes 26-50 form another densely connected cluster.
3. Nodes 51-75 form a third densely connected cluster.

These clusters are connected through a few bridging nodes, but they are largely separate from each other. Therefore, we can conclude that there are **3 communities** in the graph.
