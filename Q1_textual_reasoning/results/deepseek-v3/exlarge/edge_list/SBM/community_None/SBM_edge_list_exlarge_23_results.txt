To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since I cannot execute code directly, I will analyze the graph structure manually to identify communities.

From the edge list provided, it appears that the graph has three distinct communities based on the connectivity patterns:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-24 are densely connected among themselves, with some connections to nodes 49, 51, 55, 57, and 62.
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 25-49 are densely connected among themselves, with some connections to nodes 40, 42, 43, 46, 48, and 49.
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 50-73 are densely connected among themselves, with some connections to nodes 55, 63, 67, and 70.

Based on this analysis, the graph has **3 communities**.
