To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since I cannot execute code directly, I will analyze the graph structure manually to identify communities.

From the edge list provided, it appears that the graph can be divided into several distinct communities based on the connectivity of the nodes. Here is a rough breakdown:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-18, 35, 36, 39, 63, 69
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 19-31, 45, 66
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 32-34, 47
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 37-54
5. **Community 5**: Nodes 55-63, 64-72

Based on this analysis, the graph can be divided into **5 communities**.
