To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since I cannot run code directly, I will analyze the graph structure manually.

From the edge list provided, it appears that the graph is divided into several distinct clusters or communities. By examining the connections, we can identify the following communities:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-19, 39, 41, 48, 58, 59, 75
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 20-38, 60
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 39-57, 61-64, 66, 68, 70, 71, 73, 74, 76
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 58, 61-76

However, upon closer inspection, some nodes like 39, 41, 48, 58, 59, and 75 are shared between communities, which suggests that the communities are overlapping or that the graph is more interconnected than initially thought.

Given the complexity and the overlapping nature of the communities, it is reasonable to conclude that there are **4 distinct communities** in the graph.
