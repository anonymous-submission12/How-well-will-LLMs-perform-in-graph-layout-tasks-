To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since I cannot directly execute code, I will analyze the graph structure manually based on the edge list provided.

From the edge list, it appears that the graph is divided into several distinct clusters or communities. Here is a rough breakdown:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-10, 19, 35, 43, 73
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 11-21, 69
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 22-31, 57
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 32
5. **Community 5**: Nodes 33-42, 51
6. **Community 6**: Nodes 44-53, 56
7. **Community 7**: Nodes 54-63
8. **Community 8**: Nodes 64-73

Based on this analysis, the graph appears to have **8 communities**.
