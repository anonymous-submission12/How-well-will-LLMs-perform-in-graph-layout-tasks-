To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since we are not running actual code here, we can analyze the graph structure manually by identifying connected components or clusters of nodes that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to other clusters.

From the provided edge list, we can observe that the graph is divided into three main clusters:

1. **Cluster 1**: Nodes 0-24, 36, 59, 69
2. **Cluster 2**: Nodes 25-48, 52, 64
3. **Cluster 3**: Nodes 49-72

These clusters are identified based on the connectivity patterns in the edge list. Nodes within each cluster are densely connected, while connections between clusters are sparse or non-existent.

Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is **3**.
