To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since we are not running actual code here, we can analyze the graph structure manually by identifying disconnected components or clusters of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the graph.

From the provided edge list, we can observe that the graph is connected, meaning there are no completely disconnected components. However, we can identify clusters of nodes that form communities based on their connectivity patterns.

After analyzing the edge list, we can identify the following communities:

1. Nodes 0-9, 15, 41, 57, 75, 76
2. Nodes 10-19, 34, 62
3. Nodes 20-29, 48, 61, 71
4. Nodes 30-39, 50, 68
5. Nodes 40-49, 61
6. Nodes 50-58, 72, 76
7. Nodes 59-63, 66
8. Nodes 64-67
9. Nodes 68-74, 76

This gives us a total of 9 communities.
