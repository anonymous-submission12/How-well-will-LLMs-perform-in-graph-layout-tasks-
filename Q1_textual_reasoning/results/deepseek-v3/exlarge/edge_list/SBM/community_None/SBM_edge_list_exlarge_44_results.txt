To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since I cannot directly execute code, I will analyze the graph structure manually based on the provided edge list.

From the edge list, we can observe that the graph is divided into several connected components, each representing a community. By examining the connections, we can identify the following communities:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0, 2, 9, 10, 18, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 22, 45, 57, 65, 66, 68, 69, 70, 62, 63, 64, 67, 61, 43, 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 60.
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 11, 16, 17, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 18, 48, 51.
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 21, 23, 26, 27, 29, 40, 22, 25, 28, 30, 24.
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 32, 31, 34, 36, 37, 40, 33, 35, 38, 39, 53, 54.
5. **Community 5**: Nodes 41, 45, 46, 50, 42, 47, 49, 48, 59, 60.
6. **Community 6**: Nodes 51, 52, 56, 57, 58, 60.
7. **Community 7**: Nodes 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70.

Based on this analysis, there are **7 communities** in the graph.
