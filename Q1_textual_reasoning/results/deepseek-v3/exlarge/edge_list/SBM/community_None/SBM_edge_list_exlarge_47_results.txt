To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since I cannot execute code directly, I will analyze the graph structure manually by identifying connected components or clusters of nodes that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to other clusters.

Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. **Identify connected components**: 
   - Nodes 0 to 15 are densely connected, forming a clear community.
   - Nodes 16 to 31 are densely connected, forming another community.
   - Nodes 32 to 47 are densely connected, forming a third community.
   - Nodes 48 to 62 are densely connected, forming a fourth community.
   - Nodes 63 to 77 are densely connected, forming a fifth community.

2. **Check for overlaps or connections between communities**:
   - Node 15 is connected to node 31, which connects the first and second communities.
   - Node 49 is connected to node 50, which connects the fourth community to the third community.
   - Node 76 is connected to multiple nodes across different communities, but it primarily belongs to the fifth community.

3. **Determine the number of distinct communities**:
   - Despite some connections between communities, the graph can be divided into 5 distinct communities based on the dense internal connections and sparse external connections.

Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is **5**.
