To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since we are not running actual code here, we can analyze the graph structure manually by identifying connected components or clusters of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the graph.

From the provided edge list, we can observe that the graph has several clusters of nodes that are densely connected among themselves but have fewer connections to nodes outside their cluster. For example:

- Nodes 0-11 form a dense cluster.
- Nodes 12-23 form another cluster.
- Nodes 24-35 form another cluster.
- Nodes 36-46 form another cluster.
- Nodes 47-57 form another cluster.
- Nodes 58-68 form another cluster.
- Nodes 69-79 form another cluster.

Based on this observation, we can infer that there are **7 communities** in the graph.
