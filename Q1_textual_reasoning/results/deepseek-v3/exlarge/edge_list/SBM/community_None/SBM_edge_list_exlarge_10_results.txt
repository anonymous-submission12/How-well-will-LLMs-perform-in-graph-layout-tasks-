To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since I cannot execute code directly, I will analyze the graph structure manually to identify communities.

From the edge list provided, it appears that the graph is divided into several distinct clusters of nodes that are more densely connected within themselves than with the rest of the graph. Here is a breakdown of the communities:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-13, 17, 47
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 14-27, 57, 73
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 28-40
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 41-53, 63, 65, 79
5. **Community 5**: Nodes 54-66
6. **Community 6**: Nodes 67-79

Based on this analysis, the graph has **6 communities**.
