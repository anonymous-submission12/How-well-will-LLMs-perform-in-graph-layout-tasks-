To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since we are not running actual code here, we can analyze the graph structure manually by identifying connected components or clusters of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the graph.

From the provided edge list, we can observe that the graph is divided into several distinct clusters or communities. For example:

1. Nodes 0-12 form a densely connected cluster.
2. Nodes 13-25 form another cluster.
3. Nodes 26-38 form another cluster.
4. Nodes 39-51 form another cluster.
5. Nodes 52-63 form another cluster.
6. Nodes 64-75 form another cluster.

Based on this observation, we can conclude that there are 6 distinct communities in the graph.
