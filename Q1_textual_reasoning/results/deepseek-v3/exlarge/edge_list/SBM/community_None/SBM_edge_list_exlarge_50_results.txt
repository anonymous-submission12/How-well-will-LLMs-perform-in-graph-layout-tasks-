To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since I cannot execute code directly, I will analyze the graph structure manually to identify communities based on the connectivity of the nodes.

From the provided edge list, we can observe that the graph is divided into several distinct clusters of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the graph. Here is a breakdown of the communities:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-12, 36, 40, 45, 46, 48, 53, 59, 63
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 13-24, 60, 67
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 25-35
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 37-48
5. **Community 5**: Nodes 49-60, 71
6. **Community 6**: Nodes 61-72

Based on this analysis, the graph has **6 communities**.
