To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since I cannot directly execute code, I will analyze the graph structure manually to estimate the number of communities.

From the edge list provided, it appears that the graph is divided into two main groups of nodes:

1. Nodes 0 to 37 are densely connected among themselves.
2. Nodes 38 to 75 are also densely connected among themselves.

There are very few connections between these two groups, which suggests that they form two distinct communities.

Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is likely **2**.
