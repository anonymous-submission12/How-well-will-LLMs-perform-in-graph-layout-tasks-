To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since we are not running actual code here, we can analyze the graph structure manually by looking for densely connected subgraphs that are sparsely connected to other subgraphs.

From the provided edge list, we can observe that the graph is divided into three main communities:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-25, 29, 31, 36, 49, 58, 61, 65, 74
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 26-50
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 51-75

These communities are identified based on the dense connections within each group and the sparse connections between the groups.

Here is the JSON response with the number of communities:
