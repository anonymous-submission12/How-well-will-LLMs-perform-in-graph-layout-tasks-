To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since we are not running actual code here, we can analyze the graph structure manually by identifying densely connected subgraphs that are sparsely connected to other subgraphs.

From the provided edge list, we can observe that the graph has a clear separation between nodes with lower indices (0-25) and higher indices (26-77). This suggests that there are at least two main communities. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the nodes are further divided into smaller, densely connected groups.

After analyzing the connections, it appears that the graph can be divided into **3 main communities**:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-25
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 26-51
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 52-77

These communities are densely connected within themselves but have fewer connections to nodes in other communities.
