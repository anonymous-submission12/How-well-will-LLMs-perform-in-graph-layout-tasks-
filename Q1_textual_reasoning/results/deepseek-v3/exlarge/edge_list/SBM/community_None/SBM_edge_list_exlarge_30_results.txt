To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since we are not running actual code here, we can infer the number of communities by analyzing the connectivity of the graph.

From the provided edge list, it appears that the graph is divided into two main communities:

1. The first community includes nodes 0 through 26, 38, 40, 50, 52, 62, 70, 71, 73, 75, and 78.
2. The second community includes nodes 27 through 37, 39, 41 through 49, 51, 53 through 61, 63 through 69, 72, 74, 76, and 77.

These two communities are connected through a few edges, but the majority of the connections are within each community.

Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is 2.
