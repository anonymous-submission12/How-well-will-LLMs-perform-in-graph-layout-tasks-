To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node and then find the maximum value among these counts.

Here is the calculation:

1. **Count the degree of each node**:
   - Iterate through the edge list and count how many times each node appears.

2. **Find the maximum degree**:
   - After counting, identify the node with the highest degree.

Let's perform the calculation:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Initialize a dictionary to count the degree of each node
degree_count = defaultdict(int)

# Iterate through the edge list and count degrees
for u, v in edge_list:
    degree_count[u] += 1
    degree_count[v] += 1

# Find the maximum degree
max_degree = max(degree_count.values())
```

Now, let's wrap the result in a JSON format as requested:

```json
{
  "answer": 24
}
```

The highest degree of all nodes in the graph is **24**.
