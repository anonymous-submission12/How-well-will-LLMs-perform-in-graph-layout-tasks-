To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node and then determine the maximum degree among all nodes.

Here is the calculation:

1. **Count the degree of each node**:
   - Iterate through the edge list and count how many times each node appears.
   - For example, node `0` appears in 6 edges, so its degree is 6.

2. **Find the maximum degree**:
   - After counting the degrees of all nodes, identify the node with the highest degree.

After performing the calculations, the highest degree in the graph is **16**.

Here is the JSON response:
