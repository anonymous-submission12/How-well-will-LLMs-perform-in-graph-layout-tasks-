To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node and then find the maximum value among these counts.

Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Initialize a dictionary** to keep track of the degree of each node.
2. **Iterate through the edge list** and increment the degree count for each node involved in an edge.
3. **Find the maximum degree** from the dictionary.

Let's implement this:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Initialize a dictionary to store the degree of each node
degree = defaultdict(int)

# Iterate through the edge list and count the degrees
for u, v in edge_list:
    degree[u] += 1
    degree[v] += 1

# Find the maximum degree
max_degree = max(degree.values())

# Output the result as a JSON
result = {"answer": max_degree}
print(result)
```

Given the edge list you provided, the highest degree of all nodes in the graph is **9**.

```json
{
  "answer": 9
}
```
