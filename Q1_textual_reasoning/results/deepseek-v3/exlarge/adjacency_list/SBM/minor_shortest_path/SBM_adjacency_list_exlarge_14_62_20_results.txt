To calculate the shortest path between node '62' and '20', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the length of the shortest path:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

### Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '62' to '20' involves traversing through the following nodes: 
  - **62 → 57 → 56 → 53 → 0 → 20**
- The number of edges (hops) in this path is 4, which is the length of the shortest path.
