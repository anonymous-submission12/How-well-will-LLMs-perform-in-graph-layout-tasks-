To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '44' and '52', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

### Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '44' to '52' is as follows:
  1. 44 → 40 → 46 → 2 → 1 → 16 → 12 → 11 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 8
  2. However, this path is longer than the actual shortest path.
  3. The actual shortest path is: 44 → 40 → 46 → 2 → 1 → 16 → 12 → 11 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 8
  4. The correct shortest path is: 44 → 40 → 46 → 2 → 1 → 16 → 12 → 11 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 8
  5. The correct shortest path length is 5.

Thus, the shortest path length between node '44' and '52' is **5**.
