To find the shortest path between node '13' and '21', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for unweighted graphs. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Start from node '13'.
2. Explore all its neighbors.
3. Continue exploring neighbors level by level until node '21' is found.

Let's perform the BFS:

- **Level 0**: Start at node '13'.
- **Level 1**: Neighbors of '13' are [6, 9, 12, 16, 17, 19, 23, 24].
- **Level 2**: Neighbors of these nodes are:
  - 6: [1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 13, 18, 21, 23]
  - 9: [7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, 22]
  - 12: [2, 4, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 23, 55]
  - 16: [0, 2, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18, 22, 23, 24]
  - 17: [2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19, 20]
  - 19: [0, 1, 2, 12, 13, 15, 17, 20, 21, 22]
  - 23: [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20, 21, 22, 24]
  - 24: [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 13, 16, 21, 23]

From the above, we can see that node '21' is directly reachable from nodes [6, 9, 12, 19, 23, 24]. Therefore, the shortest path length from '13' to '21' is 2.
