To calculate the shortest path between node '66' and '57', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Here's how the BFS algorithm would work in this context:

1. Start from node '66'.
2. Explore all its neighboring nodes.
3. From each of these nodes, explore their neighbors, and so on, until node '57' is reached.
4. Keep track of the number of steps taken to reach each node.

Let's simulate this process:

- Start at node '66'. Its neighbors are [61, 65, 67, 68, 69].
- From '61', neighbors are [65, 66, 68, 70].
- From '65', neighbors are [61, 64, 66, 69].
- From '67', neighbors are [13, 62, 63, 66, 68, 69, 70].
- From '68', neighbors are [61, 62, 64, 66, 67, 71, 72].
- From '69', neighbors are [62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 70, 72].

Continuing this process, we eventually reach node '57' through a series of steps. The shortest path found is:

66 -> 67 -> 13 -> 24 -> 60 -> 57

This path involves 5 steps (edges), so the length of the shortest path is 5.
