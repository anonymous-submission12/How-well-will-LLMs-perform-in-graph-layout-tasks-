To find the shortest path between node '26' and node '4', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the length of the shortest path:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- Starting from node '26', we explore its neighbors: [1, 27, 30, 32, 35, 37].
- From node '1', we explore its neighbors: [0, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 26].
- From node '8', we explore its neighbors: [1, 2, 4, 5, 55].
- Node '4' is found in the neighbors of node '8'.

Thus, the shortest path from node '26' to node '4' is: 26 → 1 → 8 → 4, which has a length of 3.
