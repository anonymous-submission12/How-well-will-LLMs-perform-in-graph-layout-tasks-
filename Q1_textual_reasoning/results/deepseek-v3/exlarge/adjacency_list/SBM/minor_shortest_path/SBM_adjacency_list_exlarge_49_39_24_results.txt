To calculate the shortest path between node '39' and '24', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the length of the shortest path:

  "answer": 5
}
```

### Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '39' to '24' involves the following sequence of nodes: `39 → 35 → 33 → 31 → 30 → 24`.
- The number of edges traversed in this path is 5, so the length of the shortest path is 5.
