To find the shortest path between node '17' and '21', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for unweighted graphs. Here's how the BFS algorithm works in this context:

1. Start from node '17'.
2. Explore all its neighbors.
3. Move to the next level of neighbors and repeat the process until node '21' is found.
4. Keep track of the number of steps taken to reach node '21'.

Let's perform the BFS:

- Start at node '17'.
- Neighbors of '17': [14, 16, 19, 20, 24] (distance = 1).
- Neighbors of '14': [17, 22, 23, 26] (already visited '17').
- Neighbors of '16': [17, 18, 20, 22, 27] (already visited '17').
- Neighbors of '19': [17, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 67] (found '21' at distance = 2).

The shortest path from node '17' to '21' is 2 steps.
