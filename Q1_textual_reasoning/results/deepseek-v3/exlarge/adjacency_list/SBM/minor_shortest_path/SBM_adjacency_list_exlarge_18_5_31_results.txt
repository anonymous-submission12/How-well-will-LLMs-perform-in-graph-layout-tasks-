To calculate the shortest path between node '5' and node '31' in the given graph, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the length of the shortest path:

```json
{
  "answer": 5
}
```

### Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '5' to node '31' is as follows:
  - **5 → 10 → 66 → 64 → 71 → 37 → 31**
- The length of this path is **5** edges.

This is the minimum number of steps required to travel from node '5' to node '31' in the given graph.
