To calculate the shortest path between node '76' and '44', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the length of the shortest path:

```json
{
  "answer": 5
}
```

### Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '76' to '44' involves the following sequence of nodes: `76 -> 70 -> 69 -> 41 -> 44`.
- The length of this path is 5 (including the starting and ending nodes).
