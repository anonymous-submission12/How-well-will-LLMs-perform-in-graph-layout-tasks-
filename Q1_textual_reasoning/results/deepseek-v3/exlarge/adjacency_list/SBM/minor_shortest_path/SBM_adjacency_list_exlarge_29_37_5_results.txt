To calculate the shortest path between node '37' and '5', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Here's how the BFS algorithm would work in this context:

1. Start from node '37'.
2. Explore all its neighbors.
3. From each neighbor, explore their neighbors, and so on, until node '5' is reached.
4. Keep track of the number of steps taken to reach node '5'.

Let's simulate this process:

- Start at node '37'. Its neighbors are [30, 32, 36, 38, 39, 42, 44].
- From node '38', which is a neighbor of '37', we can reach node '5' directly.

Thus, the shortest path from '37' to '5' is through '38', and the length of this path is 2 (37 -> 38 -> 5).
