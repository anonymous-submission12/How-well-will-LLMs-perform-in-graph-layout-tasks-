To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '2' and node '58', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

### Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '2' to node '58' involves traversing through the following nodes: `2 -> 24 -> 46 -> 28 -> 43 -> 58`.
- The length of this path is 5 edges, so the shortest path length is 5.
