To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '45' and '41' in the given graph, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
```

The shortest path from node '45' to '41' is through the nodes '45' -> '37' -> '41', which has a length of 2.
