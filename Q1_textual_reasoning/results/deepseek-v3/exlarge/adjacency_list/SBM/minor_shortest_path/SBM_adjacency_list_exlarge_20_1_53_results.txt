To find the shortest path between node '1' and node '53', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Here's how the BFS algorithm can be applied to the given adjacency list:

1. Start from node '1'.
2. Explore all its neighbors, then explore the neighbors of those neighbors, and so on, until node '53' is found.
3. Keep track of the number of steps taken to reach each node.

Let's simulate the BFS process:

- Start at node '1'.
- From '1', we can go to nodes [0, 3, 4, 8, 9].
- From these nodes, we explore further:
  - From '0': [1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12]
  - From '3': [0, 1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11]
  - From '4': [1, 7, 8, 10, 11]
  - From '8': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10]
  - From '9': [1, 3, 5, 8, 53]

At this point, we find that node '53' is directly connected to node '9', which is one step away from node '1'. Therefore, the shortest path from '1' to '53' is 2 steps.
