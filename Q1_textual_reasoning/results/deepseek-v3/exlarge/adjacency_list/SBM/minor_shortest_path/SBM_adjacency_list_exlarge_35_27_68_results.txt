To find the shortest path between node '27' and '68', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for unweighted graphs. Here's how the BFS algorithm works in this context:

1. Start from node '27' and explore all its neighbors.
2. From each neighbor, explore their neighbors, and so on, until we reach node '68'.
3. Keep track of the number of steps taken to reach each node.

Let's perform the BFS step-by-step:

- **Step 1**: Start at node '27'. Its neighbors are [3, 6, 21, 22, 23, 29, 56].
- **Step 2**: Explore the neighbors of node '27':
  - Node '3' has neighbors [0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 13, 22, 27, 46].
  - Node '6' has neighbors [0, 1, 8, 12, 14, 15, 20, 27].
  - Node '21' has neighbors [19, 22, 23, 26, 27, 31, 33, 35, 36, 37].
  - Node '22' has neighbors [3, 20, 21, 23, 25, 27, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36].
  - Node '23' has neighbors [21, 22, 27, 32].
  - Node '29' has neighbors [27, 30, 31, 32, 34].
  - Node '56' has neighbors [27, 57, 59, 63, 64, 65, 67, 70].

- **Step 3**: Continue exploring until we reach node '68'. The shortest path from '27' to '68' involves the following steps:
  - '27' -> '56' -> '59' -> '68'.

The length of the shortest path is 3.
