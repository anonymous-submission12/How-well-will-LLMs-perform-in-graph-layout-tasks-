To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '28' and '17', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

  "answer": 4
}
```

### Explanation:
- The BFS algorithm explores all nodes level by level, starting from the source node (28 in this case).
- It finds that the shortest path from node 28 to node 17 involves 4 edges, hence the shortest path length is 4.
