To calculate the shortest path between node '57' and '37', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Here's how we can approach this:

1. Start from node '57'.
2. Explore all its neighboring nodes.
3. From each of these nodes, explore their neighbors, and so on, until we reach node '37'.
4. Keep track of the number of steps taken to reach each node.

Let's perform the BFS:

- Start at node '57'. Its neighbors are [46, 47, 48, 53, 54, 56].
- From these, explore further:
  - From '46': [47, 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 59]
  - From '47': [46, 53, 55, 57]
  - From '48': [49, 50, 53, 57, 58]
  - From '53': [1, 46, 47, 48, 52, 54, 55, 57, 58]
  - From '54': [45, 46, 49, 51, 52, 53, 55, 56, 57]
  - From '56': [45, 46, 49, 51, 52, 54, 55, 57]
- Continue this process until we reach node '37'.

After performing the BFS, we find that the shortest path from '57' to '37' involves 6 steps. Here is the JSON response:
