To find the shortest path between node '64' and '21', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for unweighted graphs. Here's how the BFS algorithm can be applied to find the shortest path:

1. Start from node '64'.
2. Explore all its adjacent nodes.
3. From each of these nodes, explore their adjacent nodes, and so on, until node '21' is reached.
4. The number of steps taken to reach node '21' from node '64' is the length of the shortest path.

Let's perform the BFS step-by-step:

- **Step 1:** Start at node '64'. Its adjacent nodes are [3, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 58, 61, 62, 66, 67, 68, 71, 72].
- **Step 2:** From node '64', explore its adjacent nodes. Node '3' is directly connected to node '21'.
- **Step 3:** Therefore, the shortest path from '64' to '21' is '64' -> '3' -> '21'.

The length of this path is 2.
