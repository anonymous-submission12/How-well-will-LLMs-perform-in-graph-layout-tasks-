To calculate the shortest path between node '49' and '75', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the length of the shortest path:

```json
{
  "answer": 5
}
```

### Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '49' to '75' is as follows:
  1. **49** → **8** → **14** → **13** → **10** → **12** → **11** → **15** → **31** → **30** → **27** → **29** → **28** → **40** → **44** → **76** → **75**
  
However, upon closer inspection, there is a more direct path:
  2. **49** → **50** → **35** → **76** → **75**

This path has a length of 4, but since the initial path was longer, I re-evaluated and found the correct shortest path:

  3. **49** → **50** → **35** → **76** → **75**

This path has a length of 4, but the initial response was incorrect. The correct shortest path length is 4.

Here is the corrected JSON response:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```
