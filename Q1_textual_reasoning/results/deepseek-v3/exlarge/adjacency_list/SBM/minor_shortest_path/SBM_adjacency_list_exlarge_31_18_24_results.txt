To calculate the shortest path between node '18' and '24', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Start from node '18'.
2. Explore all its neighbors.
3. Continue exploring the neighbors of those neighbors until node '24' is reached.
4. Keep track of the number of steps taken to reach node '24'.

Let's perform the BFS:

- Start at node '18'.
- From '18', we can go to nodes '11', '12', '15', '21', and '69'.
- From '11', we can go to nodes '12', '16', '20', '21', and '25'.
- From '12', we can go to nodes '11', '14', '16', '17', '18', '19', and '21'.
- From '15', we can go to nodes '17', '18', and '20'.
- From '21', we can go to nodes '11', '12', '13', '18', '19', and '20'.
- From '69', we can go to nodes '32' and '65'.
- From '32', we can go to nodes '23', '24', '25', and '69'.
- We have reached node '24' from '32'.

The path is: 18 → 69 → 32 → 24.

The number of steps taken is 3.
