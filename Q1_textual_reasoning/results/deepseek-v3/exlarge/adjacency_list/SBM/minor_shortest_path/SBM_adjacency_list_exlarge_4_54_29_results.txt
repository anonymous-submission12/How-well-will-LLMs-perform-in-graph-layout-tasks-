To calculate the shortest path between node '54' and '29', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the length of the shortest path:

```json
{
  "answer": 5
}
```

### Explanation:
- Starting from node '54', we explore its neighbors: '60' and '62'.
- From '60', we can reach '53', '56', '61', and '62'.
- From '62', we can reach '54', '55', '56', '57', '58', '59', '60', and '61'.
- From '56', we can reach '2', '53', '57', '59', '60', '62', and '63'.
- From '53', we can reach '31', '55', '56', and '60'.
- From '31', we can reach '27', '32', '33', '34', '35', '37', and '53'.
- From '27', we can reach '26', '29', '31', '32', and '38'.
- Finally, from '29', we reach our destination.

The shortest path from '54' to '29' involves 5 edges, so the length of the shortest path is 5.
