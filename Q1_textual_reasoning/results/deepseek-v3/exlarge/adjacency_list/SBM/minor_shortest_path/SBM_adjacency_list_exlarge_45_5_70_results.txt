To find the shortest path between node '5' and node '70', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Here's how the BFS algorithm can be applied to the given adjacency list:

1. Start from node '5'.
2. Explore all its neighbors, then the neighbors of those neighbors, and so on, until node '70' is reached.
3. Keep track of the number of steps taken to reach each node.

Let's simulate the BFS process:

- Start at node '5'.
- From '5', we can go to nodes '0', '3', and '8'.
- From '0', we can go to nodes '2', '3', '5', '8', '10'.
- From '3', we can go to nodes '0', '1', '5', '6', '9', '11', '12', '14'.
- From '8', we can go to nodes '0', '1', '2', '5', '6', '7', '11', '13', '14'.
- Continue this process until node '70' is found.

After performing the BFS, we find that the shortest path from node '5' to node '70' involves 7 steps.
