To calculate the shortest path between node '42' and '38', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the length of the shortest path:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- Starting from node '42', we explore its neighbors: '30' and '67'.
- From '30', we can reach '29', '31', and '41'.
- From '31', we can reach '38'.
- Thus, the shortest path from '42' to '38' is: `42 -> 30 -> 31 -> 38`, which has a length of 3.
