To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '15' and '44', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the calculated shortest path length:

  "answer": 5
}
```

### Explanation:
- The BFS algorithm starts at node '15' and explores all its neighbors level by level.
- It continues this process until it reaches node '44'.
- The shortest path from '15' to '44' involves 5 edges, so the length of the shortest path is 5.
