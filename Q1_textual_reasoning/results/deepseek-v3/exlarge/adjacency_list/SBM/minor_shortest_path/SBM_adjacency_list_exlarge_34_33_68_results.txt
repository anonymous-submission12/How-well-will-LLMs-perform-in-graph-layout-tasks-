To find the shortest path between node '33' and '68', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Here's how the BFS algorithm can be applied to the given adjacency list:

1. Start from node '33'.
2. Explore all its neighboring nodes.
3. Continue this process, level by level, until node '68' is reached.
4. The number of levels traversed to reach '68' will be the length of the shortest path.

Let's perform the BFS step-by-step:

- **Level 0**: Start at node '33'.
- **Level 1**: Neighbors of '33' are [37, 39, 43].
- **Level 2**: Neighbors of '37' are [31, 32, 33, 43, 67]. Neighbors of '39' are [31, 33, 34, 44]. Neighbors of '43' are [6, 32, 33, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41, 44].
- **Level 3**: From '31', neighbors are [32, 35, 37, 39, 40, 41]. From '32', neighbors are [31, 37, 40, 43]. From '67', neighbors are [37, 63, 74]. From '34', neighbors are [29, 35, 39, 42, 45]. From '44', neighbors are [39, 41, 42, 43]. From '36', neighbors are [40, 42, 43]. From '38', neighbors are [35, 43]. From '40', neighbors are [27, 31, 32, 36, 43]. From '41', neighbors are [31, 43, 44, 45, 59].
- **Level 4**: From '63', neighbors are [61, 62, 65, 67]. From '74', neighbors are [62, 64, 65, 67, 68, 71]. From '68', we have reached our target node.

The shortest path from '33' to '68' involves 4 levels of traversal. Therefore, the length of the shortest path is 4.
