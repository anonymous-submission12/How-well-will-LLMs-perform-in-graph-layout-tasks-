To find the shortest path between node '29' and node '7', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Start from node '29'.
2. Explore all its neighbors.
3. From each neighbor, explore their neighbors, and so on, until we reach node '7'.
4. Keep track of the number of steps taken to reach each node.

Let's simulate the BFS:

- **Step 1**: Start at node '29'. Neighbors: [19, 30, 31, 32, 33, 37, 40, 45, 48].
- **Step 2**: Explore neighbors of '29':
  - '19' is connected to '7' via the path: 29 → 19 → 7.
  - The path length is 2.

Thus, the shortest path from '29' to '7' is 2.
