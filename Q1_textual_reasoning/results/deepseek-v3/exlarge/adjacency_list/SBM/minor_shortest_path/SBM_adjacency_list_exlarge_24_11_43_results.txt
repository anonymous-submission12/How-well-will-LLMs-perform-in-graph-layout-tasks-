To calculate the shortest path between node '11' and '43', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the length of the shortest path:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

### Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '11' to '43' involves the following sequence of nodes: `11 -> 10 -> 16 -> 13 -> 43`.
- The length of this path is 4 edges, so the shortest path length is 4.
