To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the adjacency list provided. A community in a graph is typically defined as a group of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the graph. By examining the connections, we can identify distinct communities.

Here's the analysis:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-15 are densely connected among themselves.
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 16-31 are densely connected among themselves.
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 32-47 are densely connected among themselves.
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 48-62 are densely connected among themselves.
5. **Community 5**: Nodes 63-77 are densely connected among themselves.

Each of these groups of nodes forms a distinct community based on their connections. Therefore, there are **5 communities** in the graph.
