To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since we are not running actual code here, we can infer the number of communities by analyzing the connectivity of the graph.

From the adjacency list provided, we can observe that the graph is divided into two main groups:

1. Nodes 0 to 25 are densely connected among themselves.
2. Nodes 26 to 77 form another densely connected group.

These two groups are connected through node 20, which is connected to node 26. However, the connection between these two groups is relatively sparse compared to the connections within each group. Therefore, we can consider these two groups as separate communities.

Thus, the number of communities in the graph is 2.
