To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since we are working with a static adjacency list, we can manually inspect the graph to identify disconnected components or communities.

Upon inspecting the adjacency list, it appears that the graph is divided into three distinct communities:

1. Nodes 0 to 17 form one community.
2. Nodes 18 to 35 form another community.
3. Nodes 36 to 70 form the third community.

These communities are clearly separated and do not share any edges between them.

Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is **3**.
