To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since the graph is provided as an adjacency list, we can visually inspect the structure to identify communities.

From the adjacency list, it appears that the graph is divided into three distinct communities:

1. Nodes 0 to 25 form one community.
2. Nodes 26 to 50 form another community.
3. Nodes 51 to 75 form the third community.

These communities are clearly separated, with no edges connecting nodes from one community to another.

Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is **3**.
