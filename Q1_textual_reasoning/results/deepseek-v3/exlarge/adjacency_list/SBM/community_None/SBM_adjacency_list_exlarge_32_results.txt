To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since we are working with a static adjacency list, we can manually inspect the graph to identify communities by looking for densely connected subgraphs that are sparsely connected to other subgraphs.

From the adjacency list provided, we can observe that the graph can be divided into three main communities:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-19
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 20-39
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 40-77

These communities are identified based on the observation that nodes within each group are densely connected to each other but have fewer connections to nodes outside their group.

Thus, the number of communities in the graph is **3**.
