To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since we are working with a static adjacency list, we can manually inspect the graph to identify communities by looking for densely connected subgraphs that are sparsely connected to other subgraphs.

From the provided adjacency list, we can observe that the graph is divided into two main communities:

1. Nodes 0 to 37 form one community.
2. Nodes 38 to 75 form another community.

These two communities are clearly separated, with no edges connecting nodes from the first community to the second community.

Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is **2**.
