To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since we are working with a static adjacency list, we can manually inspect the graph to identify disconnected components or communities.

Upon inspecting the adjacency list, we can observe that the graph is connected, meaning there are no disconnected components. However, the graph has a clear community structure where nodes are more densely connected within certain groups than between them.

Let's identify the communities:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-12
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 13-25
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 26-38
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 39-51
5. **Community 5**: Nodes 52-63
6. **Community 6**: Nodes 64-75

Each of these groups forms a distinct community based on the adjacency list provided.

Thus, the number of communities in the graph is **6**.
