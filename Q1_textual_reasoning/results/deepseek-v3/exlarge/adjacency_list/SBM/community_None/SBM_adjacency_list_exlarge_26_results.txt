To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, for simplicity, we can visually inspect the adjacency list to identify disconnected components or communities.

From the provided adjacency list, we can observe that the graph is connected, meaning there is a path between any two nodes. However, the graph has a community structure where nodes are more densely connected within certain groups than between groups.

After analyzing the adjacency list, we can identify the following communities:

1. Nodes 0-12, 26, 55
2. Nodes 13-25, 27-38, 58
3. Nodes 39-50
4. Nodes 51-62
5. Nodes 63-74

Thus, there are **5 communities** in the graph.
