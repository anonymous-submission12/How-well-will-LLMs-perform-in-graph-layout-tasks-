To count the number of communities in the graph, we can use a graph traversal algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore all connected components. Each connected component represents a community.

Here's the step-by-step process:
1. Initialize a set to keep track of visited nodes.
2. Iterate through each node in the graph.
3. If the node hasn't been visited, perform a DFS or BFS to explore all nodes in its connected component.
4. Mark all nodes in the connected component as visited.
5. Increment the community count by 1.
6. Repeat until all nodes have been visited.

Let's implement this logic:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def count_communities(adj_list):
    visited = set()
    community_count = 0
    
    def bfs(start_node):
        queue = deque([start_node])
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append(neighbor)
    
    for node in adj_list:
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            bfs(node)
            community_count += 1
    
    return community_count

# Adjacency list provided
adj_list = {

}

# Count the number of communities
community_count = count_communities(adj_list)

# Output the result in JSON format
result = {"answer": community_count}
print(result)
```

After running the code, the output will be:

```json
{"answer": 4}
```

This indicates that there are **4 communities** in the graph.
