To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since we are not running actual code here, we can analyze the graph structure manually by identifying disconnected components or clusters of nodes that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to other clusters.

From the provided adjacency list, we can observe that the graph is divided into several distinct clusters:

1. Nodes 0-13 form a densely connected cluster.
2. Nodes 14-27 form another densely connected cluster.
3. Nodes 28-40 form a separate cluster.
4. Nodes 41-53 form another cluster.
5. Nodes 54-66 form a cluster.
6. Nodes 67-79 form the final cluster.

Each of these clusters is densely connected internally and has few or no connections to nodes outside their cluster, indicating that they are separate communities.

Thus, the graph has **6 communities**.
