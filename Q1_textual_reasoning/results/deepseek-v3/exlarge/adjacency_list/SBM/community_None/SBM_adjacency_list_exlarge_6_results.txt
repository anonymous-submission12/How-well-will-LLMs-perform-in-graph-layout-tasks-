To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since we are working with a static adjacency list, we can manually inspect the graph to identify communities based on the connectivity of nodes.

Upon inspecting the adjacency list, we can observe that the graph is divided into several distinct groups of nodes that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to other groups. Here are the communities identified:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-13
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 14-26
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 27-39
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 40-52
5. **Community 5**: Nodes 53-65
6. **Community 6**: Nodes 66-78

Each of these communities is a separate group of nodes that are more connected to each other than to nodes outside their group.
