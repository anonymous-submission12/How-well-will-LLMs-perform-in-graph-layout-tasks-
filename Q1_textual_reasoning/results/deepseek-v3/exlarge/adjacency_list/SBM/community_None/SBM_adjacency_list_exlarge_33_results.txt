To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or the Girvan-Newman algorithm. However, since the graph is provided as an adjacency list, we can also visually inspect the structure to identify communities.

From the adjacency list, it appears that the graph is divided into two distinct communities:

1. Nodes 0 to 36 form one community.
2. Nodes 37 to 73 form another community.

These two communities are clearly separated, with no edges connecting nodes from the first community to the second community.

Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is **2**.
