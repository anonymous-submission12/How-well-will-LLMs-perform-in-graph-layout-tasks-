To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since we are not running actual code here, we can analyze the graph structure manually by observing the connectivity patterns.

From the adjacency list provided, we can see that the graph is divided into three distinct groups of nodes that are densely connected within themselves but sparsely connected to nodes outside their group:

1. Nodes 0 to 25 form a densely connected community.
2. Nodes 26 to 50 form another densely connected community.
3. Nodes 51 to 75 form the third densely connected community.

Each of these groups represents a distinct community in the graph. Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is 3.
