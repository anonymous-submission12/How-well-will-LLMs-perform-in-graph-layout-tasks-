To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since we are working with a static adjacency list, we can manually identify communities by analyzing the connectivity of the nodes.

From the adjacency list provided, we can observe that the graph is divided into several distinct groups of nodes that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to other groups. Here is a breakdown of the communities:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-14, 40, 45
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 15-28, 52
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 29-42, 66
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 43-56
5. **Community 5**: Nodes 57-70, 68

Each of these communities is a separate group of nodes that are more connected to each other than to nodes outside their group. Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is 5.
