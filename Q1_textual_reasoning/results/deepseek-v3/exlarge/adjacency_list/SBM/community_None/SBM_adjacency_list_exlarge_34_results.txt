To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since we are not running actual code here, we can analyze the graph structure manually by identifying disconnected components or clusters of nodes that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to other clusters.

From the adjacency list provided, we can observe that the graph is divided into several distinct clusters of nodes that are interconnected within themselves but have few or no connections to nodes outside their cluster. Here's a breakdown of the communities:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-15, 56 (connected through nodes like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 56)
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 16-30 (connected through nodes like 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30)
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 31-45 (connected through nodes like 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45)
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 46-60 (connected through nodes like 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60)
5. **Community 5**: Nodes 61-75 (connected through nodes like 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75)

Each of these communities is a densely connected subgraph with minimal connections to other communities. Therefore, the graph has **5 communities**.
