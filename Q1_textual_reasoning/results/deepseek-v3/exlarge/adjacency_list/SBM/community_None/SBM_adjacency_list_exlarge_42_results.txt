To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since we are not running actual code here, we can analyze the graph structure manually by identifying densely connected subgraphs that are sparsely connected to other subgraphs.

From the adjacency list provided, we can observe that the graph has a clear separation between nodes 0-25 and nodes 26-77. Nodes 0-25 are densely connected among themselves, and nodes 26-77 are also densely connected among themselves, with very few connections between these two groups. This suggests that there are at least two communities.

However, within the group of nodes 26-77, there are further subdivisions. For example, nodes 26-51 are connected to each other, and nodes 52-77 are connected to each other, with some overlap. This suggests that there might be more than two communities.

After a closer inspection, it appears that the graph can be divided into three main communities:

1. Nodes 0-25
2. Nodes 26-51
3. Nodes 52-77

Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is 3.
