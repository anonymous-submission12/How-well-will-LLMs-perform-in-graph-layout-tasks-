To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since the graph is provided as an adjacency list, we can also analyze the connectivity between nodes to identify communities.

Upon inspecting the adjacency list, it appears that the graph is divided into two main communities:

1. Nodes 0-26 form a densely connected subgraph.
2. Nodes 27-78 form another densely connected subgraph.

These two subgraphs are connected through node 1, which is connected to node 78. However, the connection between these two subgraphs is relatively weak compared to the internal connections within each subgraph.

Therefore, we can conclude that there are **2 communities** in the graph.
