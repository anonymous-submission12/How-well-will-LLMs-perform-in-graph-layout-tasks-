To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since we are working with a static adjacency list, we can manually inspect the graph to identify disconnected components or communities.

Upon inspecting the adjacency list, we can observe that the graph is divided into three distinct communities:

1. Nodes 0-24 form one community.
2. Nodes 25-48 form another community.
3. Nodes 49-72 form the third community.

These communities are clearly separated, with no edges connecting nodes from one community to another.

Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is **3**.
