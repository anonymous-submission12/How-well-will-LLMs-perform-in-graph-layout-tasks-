To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since the graph is provided as an adjacency list, we can visually inspect the structure to identify communities.

From the adjacency list, it appears that the graph is divided into three distinct communities:

1. Nodes 0 to 24 form the first community.
2. Nodes 25 to 49 form the second community.
3. Nodes 50 to 73 form the third community.

These communities are clearly separated, with no edges connecting nodes from one community to another.

Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is **3**.
