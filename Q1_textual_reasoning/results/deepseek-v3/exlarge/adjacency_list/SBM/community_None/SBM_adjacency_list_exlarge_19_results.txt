To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since we are working with a static adjacency list, we can manually inspect the graph to identify communities based on the connectivity of nodes.

Upon inspecting the adjacency list, we can observe that the graph is divided into several distinct groups of nodes that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to other groups. Here are the communities identified:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-18 (connected through nodes like 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.)
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 19-36 (connected through nodes like 19, 20, 21, etc.)
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 37-54 (connected through nodes like 37, 38, 39, etc.)
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 55-72 (connected through nodes like 55, 56, 57, etc.)

These communities are identified based on the dense connections within each group and the sparse connections between groups.

Thus, the number of communities in the graph is **4**.
