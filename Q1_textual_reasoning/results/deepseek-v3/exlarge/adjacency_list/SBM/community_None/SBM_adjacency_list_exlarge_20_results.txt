To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the adjacency list provided. A community in a graph is typically a set of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the graph. By examining the connections, we can identify distinct communities.

Here is the analysis:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-12 are interconnected, forming a dense subgraph.
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 13-24 are interconnected, forming another dense subgraph.
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 25-36 are interconnected, forming a third dense subgraph.
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 37-48 are interconnected, forming a fourth dense subgraph.
5. **Community 5**: Nodes 49-60 are interconnected, forming a fifth dense subgraph.
6. **Community 6**: Nodes 61-72 are interconnected, forming a sixth dense subgraph.

Each of these groups of nodes forms a distinct community based on their connections. Therefore, there are 6 communities in the graph.
