To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since we are working with a static adjacency list, we can manually identify communities by looking for connected components or clusters of nodes that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to other clusters.

Upon analyzing the adjacency list, we can observe that the graph is divided into several distinct communities. Here is a breakdown of the communities based on the connections:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-13, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 28, 29, 30, 31, 45, 47, 50, 52, 53, 64, 65, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79.
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 14-27.
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 41-44, 46, 48, 49, 51.

These communities are identified based on the dense connections within each group and the sparse connections between them.
