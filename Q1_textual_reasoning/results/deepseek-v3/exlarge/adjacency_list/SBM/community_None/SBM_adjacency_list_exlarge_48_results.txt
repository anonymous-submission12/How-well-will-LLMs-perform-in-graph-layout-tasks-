To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since we are not running actual code here, we can infer the number of communities by analyzing the adjacency list and identifying disconnected components or clusters.

From the provided adjacency list, it appears that the graph is divided into three main clusters:

1. Nodes 0 to 25 form a densely connected cluster.
2. Nodes 26 to 51 form another densely connected cluster.
3. Nodes 52 to 77 form the third densely connected cluster.

These clusters are interconnected through a few nodes, but they are distinct enough to be considered separate communities.

Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is **3**.
