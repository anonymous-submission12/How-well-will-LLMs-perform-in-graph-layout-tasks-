To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since we are working with a static adjacency list, we can manually identify communities by analyzing the connectivity of the nodes.

After analyzing the adjacency list, we can observe that the graph is divided into distinct communities based on the connectivity of the nodes. Here is the JSON response with the number of communities:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

This response indicates that there are 4 distinct communities in the provided graph.
