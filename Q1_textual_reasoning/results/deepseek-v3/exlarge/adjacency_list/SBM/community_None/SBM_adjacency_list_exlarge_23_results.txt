To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since we are not running actual code here, we can infer the communities by analyzing the adjacency list and identifying clusters of nodes that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to other clusters.

By examining the adjacency list, we can observe that the graph can be divided into three main communities:

1. Nodes 0-24: These nodes are densely connected among themselves and have fewer connections to nodes outside this range.
2. Nodes 25-49: These nodes form another densely connected cluster with minimal connections to nodes outside this range.
3. Nodes 50-73: These nodes form a third densely connected cluster with minimal connections to nodes outside this range.

Thus, the graph has three distinct communities.
