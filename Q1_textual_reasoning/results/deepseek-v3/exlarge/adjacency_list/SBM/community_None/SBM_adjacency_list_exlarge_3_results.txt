To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since we are working with a static adjacency list, we can manually inspect the graph to identify communities based on the connectivity of nodes.

Upon inspecting the adjacency list, we can observe that the graph is divided into two main communities:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-24 are densely connected among themselves.
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 25-72 are densely connected among themselves.

These two communities are connected through a few edges, but the majority of connections are within each community.

Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is **2**.
