To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since I cannot execute code directly, I will analyze the graph structure manually.

From the adjacency list provided, it appears that the graph is divided into two distinct communities:

1. Nodes 0 to 38 are densely connected among themselves.
2. Nodes 39 to 76 are densely connected among themselves.

There are no connections between nodes in the first group (0-38) and the second group (39-76), indicating that these are two separate communities.

Therefore, the number of communities in the graph is 2.
