To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since we are working with a static adjacency list, we can manually inspect the graph to identify communities based on the connectivity of nodes.

From the adjacency list provided, we can observe that the graph is divided into several distinct groups of nodes that are densely connected within themselves but sparsely connected to other groups. Here is a breakdown of the communities:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-12, 18, 46, 77
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 13-25, 33
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 26-38
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 39-51
5. **Community 5**: Nodes 52-64
6. **Community 6**: Nodes 65-77

These communities are identified based on the dense connections within each group and the sparse connections between groups. For example, nodes 0-12 are heavily interconnected, and node 18 is connected to node 1, which is part of this community. Similarly, nodes 13-25 form another densely connected group, and so on.

Thus, the graph has **6 communities**.
