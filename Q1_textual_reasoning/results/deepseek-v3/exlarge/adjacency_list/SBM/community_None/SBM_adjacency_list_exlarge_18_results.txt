To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since we are working with a static adjacency list, we can manually inspect the graph to identify communities based on the connectivity of nodes.

From the adjacency list provided, we can observe that the graph is divided into several distinct groups of nodes that are densely connected within themselves but sparsely connected with other groups. Here's a breakdown of the communities:

1. **Community 1**: Nodes 0-14, 46, 54, 61, 63, 66, 68, 71
2. **Community 2**: Nodes 15-29
3. **Community 3**: Nodes 30-43
4. **Community 4**: Nodes 44-57
5. **Community 5**: Nodes 58-65, 67, 69, 70

These communities are identified based on the dense connections within each group and the sparse connections between groups.
