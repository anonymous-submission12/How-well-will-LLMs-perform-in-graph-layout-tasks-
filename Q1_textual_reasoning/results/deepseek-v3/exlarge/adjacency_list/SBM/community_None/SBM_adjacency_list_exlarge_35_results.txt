To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or label propagation. However, since I cannot execute code directly, I will analyze the graph structure manually to identify communities based on connectivity.

### Observations:
1. The graph is divided into two main groups:
   - Nodes 0 to 55 form a densely connected subgraph.
   - Nodes 56 to 73 form another densely connected subgraph.
2. There is no overlap or connection between these two groups.

### Conclusion:
The graph has **2 distinct communities**.
