To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '18' and '72' in the given graph, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the length of the shortest path:

```json
{
  "answer": 54
}
```

### Explanation:
- The graph is a linear chain from node 0 to node 75, with each node connected to the next one.
- Starting from node 18, we can traverse to node 72 by moving forward through the chain.
- The number of steps required to go from node 18 to node 72 is 54 (since 72 - 18 = 54).

Thus, the shortest path length is 54.
