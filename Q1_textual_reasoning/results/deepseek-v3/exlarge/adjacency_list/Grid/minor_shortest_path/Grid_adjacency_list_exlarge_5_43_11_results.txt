To calculate the shortest path between node '43' and '11', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the length of the shortest path:

{
  "answer": 8
}
```

### Explanation:
- The BFS algorithm starts at node '43' and explores all its neighbors, then the neighbors of those neighbors, and so on, until it reaches node '11'.
- The shortest path from '43' to '11' involves 8 edges, so the length of the shortest path is 8.
