To find the shortest path between node '34' and '47', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the length of the shortest path:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```

### Explanation:
- Node '34' is directly connected to node '47' in the graph. Therefore, the shortest path between them is of length 1.
