To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '31' and '48' in the given graph, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the JSON response with the length of the shortest path:

```json
{
  "answer": 17
}
```

### Explanation:
- The BFS algorithm starts at node '31' and explores all its neighbors, then the neighbors of those neighbors, and so on, until it reaches node '48'.
- The shortest path from '31' to '48' involves traversing 17 edges, hence the length of the shortest path is 17.
