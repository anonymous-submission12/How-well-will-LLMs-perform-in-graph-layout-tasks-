### Explanation:
The graph provided is a star-shaped graph where node `0` is connected to all other nodes (including `28` and `30`), and all other nodes are only connected to node `0`. 

To find the shortest path between node `28` and `30`:
1. Start at node `28`.
2. Move to node `0` (1 step).
3. Move from node `0` to node `30` (1 step).

Thus, the shortest path length is **2**.
