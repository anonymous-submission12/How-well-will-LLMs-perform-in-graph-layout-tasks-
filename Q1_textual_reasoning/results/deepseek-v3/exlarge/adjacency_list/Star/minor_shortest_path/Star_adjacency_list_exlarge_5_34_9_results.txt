### Explanation:
The graph provided is a star-shaped graph where node `0` is connected to all other nodes (including `34` and `9`), and no other connections exist between the nodes. Therefore, the shortest path from node `34` to node `9` is through node `0`. The path is `34 -> 0 -> 9`, which has a length of 2.
