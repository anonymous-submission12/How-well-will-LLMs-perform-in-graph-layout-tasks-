To calculate the shortest path between node '6' and node '16', we treat the graph as an unweighted graph and use a breadth-first search (BFS).

Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

Let me explain how this result was achieved:
1. From node '6':
   - Direct connections: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 17].
2. From node '17':
   - Direct connections: [6, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20].
3. From node '16':
   - Trace back along connections: [14, 15, 17].

The shortest path from node '6' to node '16' traverses node '17,' requiring 3 steps.
