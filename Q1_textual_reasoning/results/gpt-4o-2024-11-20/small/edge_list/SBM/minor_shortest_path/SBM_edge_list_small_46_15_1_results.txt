To calculate the shortest path between node '15' and node '1', we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm since the graph is unweighted. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

Explanation:
1. The graph is represented as an edge list.
2. Using BFS, we find the shortest path from node '15' to node '1'.
3. The shortest path is: 15 → 12 → 0 → 1, which has a length of 3.
