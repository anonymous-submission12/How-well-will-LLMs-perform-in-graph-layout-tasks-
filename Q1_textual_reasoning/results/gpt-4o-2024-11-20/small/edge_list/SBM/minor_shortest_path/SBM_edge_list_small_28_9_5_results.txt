To calculate the shortest path between nodes '9' and '5', we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm since the graph is unweighted. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```

### Explanation:
From the edge list provided, we can see that there is a direct edge between node '9' and node '5'. Therefore, the shortest path length between these two nodes is 1.
