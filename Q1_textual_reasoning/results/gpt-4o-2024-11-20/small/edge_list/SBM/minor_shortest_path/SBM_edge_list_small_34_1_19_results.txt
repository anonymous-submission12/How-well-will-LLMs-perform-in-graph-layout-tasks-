To calculate the shortest path between node '1' and node '19', we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm since the graph is unweighted. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '1' to node '19' is: 1 → 5 → 17 → 19.
- This path has a length of 4 edges.
