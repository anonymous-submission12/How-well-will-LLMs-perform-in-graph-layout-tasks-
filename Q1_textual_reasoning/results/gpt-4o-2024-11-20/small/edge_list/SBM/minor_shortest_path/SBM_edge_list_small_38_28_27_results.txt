To calculate the shortest path between nodes '28' and '27', we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS). Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```

Explanation:
- The edge list includes a direct connection between nodes '28' and '27', as seen in the edge `(27, 28)`.
- Therefore, the shortest path length between these two nodes is `1`.
