To calculate the shortest path between nodes `15` and `20`, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm since the graph is unweighted. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```

### Explanation:
From the edge list provided, node `15` is directly connected to node `20`. Therefore, the shortest path length between `15` and `20` is `1`.
