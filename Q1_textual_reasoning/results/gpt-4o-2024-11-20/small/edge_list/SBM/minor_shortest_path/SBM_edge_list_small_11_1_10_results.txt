To calculate the shortest path between node '1' and node '10', we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm since the graph is unweighted. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```

### Explanation:
- The edge list provided represents an undirected graph.
- From the edge list, we can see that there is a direct edge between node '1' and node '10'.
- Therefore, the shortest path length between node '1' and node '10' is `1`.
