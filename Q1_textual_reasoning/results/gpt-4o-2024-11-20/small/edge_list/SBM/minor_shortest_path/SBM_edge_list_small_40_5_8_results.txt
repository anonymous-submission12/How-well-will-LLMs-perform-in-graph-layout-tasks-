To solve this problem, I'll compute the shortest path from node '5' to node '8' on the given graph, represented by the edge list. Here's the calculated result:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
``` 

Explanation:
1. The graph is undirected, so connections are bidirectional.
2. A breadth-first search (BFS) is the most efficient way to calculate the minimum path length, as all edge weights are equal.

Following the BFS traversal, the shortest path from node '5' to node '8' passes through nodes '5 → 0 → 6 → 8', with a length of 4 steps.
