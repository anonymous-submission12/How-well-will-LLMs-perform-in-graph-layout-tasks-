To calculate the shortest path between nodes `16` and `2` using the edge list, we can treat the provided graph as an unweighted graph and perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path.

After performing the BFS:

1. Nodes `16` and `2` belong to different connected components. Specifically:
   - Node `16` is in a connected component with nodes `{10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 23}`.
   - Node `2` is in a connected component with nodes `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 23}`.
   - There is no path between these two nodes.

Hence, the shortest path does not exist.
