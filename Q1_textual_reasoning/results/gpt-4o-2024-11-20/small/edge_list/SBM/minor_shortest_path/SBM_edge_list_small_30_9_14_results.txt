To calculate the shortest path between nodes '9' and '14', we need to analyze the given graph. We can use a breadth-first search algorithm to determine the shortest length since the graph is unweighted. 

Now, let's determine the shortest path:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

Explanation:
1. The graph consists of two interconnected clusters: one centering around node '9' and another around node '14'.
2. Nodes '9' → '13' → '18' → '14' form the shortest path, with three edges connecting them:
   - Edge (9, 13)
   - Edge (13, 18)
   - Edge (18, 14)

Thus, the shortest path length is `3`.
