To calculate the shortest path between nodes '27' and '13', we can use a graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS). Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '27' to node '13' is: 27 → 21 → 18 → 13.
- This path has a length of 4 edges.
