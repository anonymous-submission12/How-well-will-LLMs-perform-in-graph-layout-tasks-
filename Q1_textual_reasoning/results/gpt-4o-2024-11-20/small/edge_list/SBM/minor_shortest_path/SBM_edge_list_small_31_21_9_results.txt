To calculate the shortest path between node '21' and node '9', we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the graph based on the edge list provided, as it's an unweighted graph.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
```

Explanation:
- From node `21`, you can move directly to node `22` via the edge `(21, 22)`.
- From node `22`, you can move directly to node `9` via the edge `(22, 9)`.

Thus, the shortest path from `21` to `9` consists of 2 hops, so the length of the shortest path is `2`.
