To calculate the shortest path between nodes '21' and '26', we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm since the graph is unweighted. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
``` 

Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '21' to '26' is through node '20'. The path is: 21 → 20 → 26.
- This path has a length of 2.
