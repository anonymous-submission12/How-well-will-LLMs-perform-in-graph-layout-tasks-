To determine the shortest path between node `1` and node `7`, we can analyze the graph structure. It is clear that the graph can be divided into distinct components since the edge list does not provide any connection between the component containing node `1` and the component containing node `7`. Therefore, there is no path between node `1` and node `7`.

Here is the JSON response with the answer:

```json
{
  "answer": -1
}
``` 

This output uses `-1` to indicate that there is no path between the two nodes.
