To calculate the shortest path between nodes '9' and '6', we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm since the graph is unweighted. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
``` 

Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '9' to node '6' is through node '1' or node '2'. For example, one path is `9 -> 1 -> 6`, which has a length of 2.
