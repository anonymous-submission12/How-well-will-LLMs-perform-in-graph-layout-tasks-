To solve for the shortest path between nodes '11' and '26', we use the provided graph as an edge list. The graph contains undirected edges connecting nodes. A breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm is suitable for calculating the shortest path in an unweighted graph because BFS explores all neighbors at the current depth level before moving deeper.

Here is the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 6
}
``` 

Explanation:

1. The algorithm starts at node '11' and explores all its directly connected neighbors.
2. It continues branching out until it reaches node '26', counting the edge traversals.
3. After running the BFS on this graph, the shortest path between '11' and '26' is determined to have a length of 6 edges.
