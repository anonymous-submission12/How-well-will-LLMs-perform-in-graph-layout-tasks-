To calculate the shortest path between nodes '15' and '23', we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm since the graph is unweighted. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
}
```

Explanation:
The shortest path from node '15' to node '23' is:
15 → 17 → 18 → 19 → 23, which has a length of 4.
