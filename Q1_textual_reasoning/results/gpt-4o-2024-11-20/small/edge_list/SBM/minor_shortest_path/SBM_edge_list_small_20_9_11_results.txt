To solve this problem, we will use Breadth-First Search (BFS) because it is an efficient way to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Let's calculate the shortest path between nodes '9' and '11'.

### Calculation

1. Represent the graph as an adjacency list for efficient traversal.
2. Use BFS starting from node 9 and stop when node 11 is reached.
3. Count the number of edges in the shortest path.

Here is the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
```

Explanation: The shortest path from node 9 to node 11 is `9 -> 6 -> 11`, which consists of 2 edges.
