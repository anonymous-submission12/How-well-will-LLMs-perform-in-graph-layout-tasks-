To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we will compute the degree of each node (number of connections) in the given edge list and identify the maximum degree.

Here is the calculation:

1. Count connections for each node in the edge list.
2. Find the maximum of these counts.

Below is the JSON result wrapped in a code block:

```json
{
  "answer": 8
}
```

Explanation:
The node with the highest degree is node `10`, with a degree of `8`.
