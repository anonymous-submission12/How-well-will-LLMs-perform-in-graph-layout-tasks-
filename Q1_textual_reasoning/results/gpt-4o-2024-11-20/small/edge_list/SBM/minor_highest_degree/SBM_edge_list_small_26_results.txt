To solve for the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of connections (edges) each node has and identify the node with the maximum degree.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. Parse the edge list and count degrees for each node.
2. Identify the node with the highest degree.

Let me process this:

### Graph Data:
The edge list:  
[(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 11), (0, 13), (0, 14),  
 (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 19),  
 (2, 3), (2, 6),  
 (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6),  
 (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 18),  
 (5, 6), (5, 9),  
 (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 12), (7, 13),  
 (8, 9), (8, 11), (8, 12), (8, 13),  
 (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 12),  
 (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 13), (10, 14),  
 (11, 12), (11, 13),  
 (12, 13),  
 (14, 15), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (14, 20),  
 (15, 16), (15, 17), (15, 18), (15, 20),  
 (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 19), (16, 20),  
 (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 20),  
 (18, 19), (18, 20)].

### Calculation:
We count the occurrences of each node in the edge list:

#### Degrees:
- Node 0: 10
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 6
- Node 10: 6
- Node 11: 7
- Node 12: 6
- Node 13: 6
- Node 14: 6
- Node 15: 5
- Node 16: 5
- Node 17: 5
- Node 18: 7
- Node 19: 5
- Node 20: 5

The node with the highest degree is **Node 0**, with a degree of **10**.

### Result:
```json
{
  "answer": 10
}
```
