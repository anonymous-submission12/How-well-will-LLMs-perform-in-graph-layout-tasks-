To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, I will find out how many edges are connected to each node and determine the maximum number of edges for any node.

Here is the calculation:

### Step 1: Count edges for each node
The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. We will iterate through the edge list and count the connections for each node.

### Step 2: Identify the maximum degree
Once the degrees are calculated, the highest degree is the maximum among all degrees.

### Calculation:
```json
{
  "answer": 8
}
```

Explanation:
- Node `1` has connections: `{0, 2, 4, 5, 9}` â†’ Degree `8`
-
