To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node and find the maximum degree. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 8
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph is represented as an edge list.
- The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.
- After processing the edge list, the node with the highest degree is node `6`, which has a degree of `8`.
