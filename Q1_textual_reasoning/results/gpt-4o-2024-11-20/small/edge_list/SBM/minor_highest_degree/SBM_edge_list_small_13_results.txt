To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 12
}
```

Explanation:
- The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.
- After analyzing the graph data, the node with the highest degree is node `21`, which has 12 edges connected to it.
