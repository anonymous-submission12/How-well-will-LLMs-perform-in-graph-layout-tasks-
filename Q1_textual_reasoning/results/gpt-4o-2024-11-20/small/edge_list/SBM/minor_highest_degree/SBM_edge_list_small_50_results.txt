To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node and find the maximum.

Here is the solution:

1. Parse the edge list.
2. Count the degree of each node.
3. Find the maximum degree.

The highest degree in the graph is **6**, which corresponds to node 16.

Here is the JSON response:
