To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 8
}
```

Explanation:
- The node with the highest degree is node `24`, which is connected to 8 other nodes: `4, 12, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24`.
