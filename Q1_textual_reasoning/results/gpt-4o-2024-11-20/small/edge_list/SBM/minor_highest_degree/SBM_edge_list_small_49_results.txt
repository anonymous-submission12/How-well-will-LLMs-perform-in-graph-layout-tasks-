To solve the problem, we calculate the degree of each node in the graph. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. By iterating through the `edge_list` and counting occurrences for each node, we determine the highest degree.

Here is the result in the required JSON format:

```json
{
  "answer": 13
}
```

Explanation:
- After processing the `edge_list` and counting connections for each node, the maximum degree found is 13. This is the highest number of edges connected to a single node in the graph.
