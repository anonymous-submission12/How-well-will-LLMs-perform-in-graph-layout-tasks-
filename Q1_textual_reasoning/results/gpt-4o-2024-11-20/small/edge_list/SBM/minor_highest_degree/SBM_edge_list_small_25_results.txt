To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in a graph, we first count the number of edges connected to each node and then identify the node with the maximum degree (number of edges).

Below is the JSON-formatted response wrapped in a code block:

```json
{
  "answer": 10
}
```

Explanation: 
After iterating through the edge list provided, the highest degree (the number of edges connected to a single node) is found to be **10**, with node `11` having the most connections in the graph.
