To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node and find the maximum degree. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 10
}
```

Explanation:
- The node with the highest degree is node `6`, which is connected to 10 other nodes: `0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 3, 4`.
