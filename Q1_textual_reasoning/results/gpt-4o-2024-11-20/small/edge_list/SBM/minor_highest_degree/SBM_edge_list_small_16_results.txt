To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node and find the maximum value. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 10
}
```

Explanation:
- The node with the highest degree is node `6`, which is connected to 10 other nodes: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 15, 16, 18, 19`.
