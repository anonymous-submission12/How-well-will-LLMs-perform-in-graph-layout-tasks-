To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the degree of each node. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. Here's the solution:

### Steps:
1. Parse the edge list to count the degree of each node.
2. Find the maximum degree among all nodes.

### Calculation:
The edge list is:
```
[(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 11), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 10), (3, 17), (4, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 11), (8, 9), (8, 10), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 14), (11, 15), (12, 13), (12, 15), (12, 16), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 16), (14, 15), (14, 16), (15, 16), (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 20), (17, 21), (18, 19), (18, 20), (20, 21)]
```

We count the degree of each node:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 3
- Node 10: 5
- Node 11: 6
- Node 12: 3
- Node 13: 4
- Node 14: 4
- Node 15: 5
- Node 16: 4
- Node 17: 5
- Node 18: 3
- Node 19: 2
- Node 20: 3
- Node 21: 2

The highest degree is **6**, which occurs for nodes 1 and 11.
