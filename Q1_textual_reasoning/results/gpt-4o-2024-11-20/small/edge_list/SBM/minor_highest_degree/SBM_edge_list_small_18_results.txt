To solve this problem, we will calculate the degree of each node in the graph. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. Then, we will determine the highest degree among all the nodes.

Here is the calculation and the resulting JSON:

```json
{
  "answer": 13
}
```

Explanation:
- The node with the highest degree in this graph is node `23`, with a degree of `13` (connected to 13 other nodes). Other nodes have fewer connections.
