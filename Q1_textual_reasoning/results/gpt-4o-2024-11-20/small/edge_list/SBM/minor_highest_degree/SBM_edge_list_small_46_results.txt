To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. Here's the solution:

```json
{

}
```

Explanation:
- The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.
- After analyzing the graph data, node `7` has the highest degree, with 8 edges connected to it.
