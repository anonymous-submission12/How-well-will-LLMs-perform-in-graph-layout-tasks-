To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use community detection algorithms such as the "Louvain method" or a modularity-based approach. These algorithms partition the graph into subgraphs or communities.

Based on the structure of the graph data provided in the edge list, I identify two distinct communities corresponding to the cluster of nodes around `{0, 1, 2, ...}` and `{13, 14, 15, ...}`. Hence, there are **two communities** in this graph.
