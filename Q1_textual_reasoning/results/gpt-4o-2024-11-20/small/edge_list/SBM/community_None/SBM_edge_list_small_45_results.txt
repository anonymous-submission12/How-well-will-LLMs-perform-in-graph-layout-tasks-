To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the connected components. Let me provide the count of connected components in this graph.

The graph represented has the following edges:

```python
edge_list = [
    (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5),
    (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10),
    (7, 11), (7, 14), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), (12, 13),
    (12, 14), (12, 17), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (13, 23), (14, 15), (14, 17),
    (15, 16), (15, 17), (16, 17), (16, 22), (18, 19), (18, 21), (18, 22), (18, 23),
    (19, 20), (19, 21), (19, 22), (20, 21), (20, 22), (20, 23), (21, 22), (21, 23),
    (22, 23)
]
```

Using these edges, the graph can be divided into the following connected components:

1. Nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
2. Nodes {6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14}
3. Nodes {12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 22, 23}
4. Nodes {18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23}

From this analysis, there are **4 distinct communities** in the graph.

Here is the JSON output:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
