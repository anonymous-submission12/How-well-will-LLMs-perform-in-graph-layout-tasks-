To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or modularity-based approaches. However, based on the edge list provided, we can visually identify clusters of nodes that are densely connected. 

Here are the communities in the graph:
1. Nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 17, 19}
2. Nodes {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16}
3. Nodes {16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22}

Thus, there are **3 communities** in the graph.
