To compute the number of communities in the graph, we can use community detection methods such as the connected components approach (for unweighted graphs) or algorithms like modularity-based methods. Based on the given edge list, let's calculate the number of communities in this graph.

After analyzing the provided edge list, these are the communities identified:
- Community 1: Nodes connected to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 15.
- Community 2: Nodes connected to 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
- Community 3: Nodes connected to 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.

Thus, the graph contains **3 communities**.
