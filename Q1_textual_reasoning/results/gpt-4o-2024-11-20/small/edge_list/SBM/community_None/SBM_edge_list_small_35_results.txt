To determine the number of communities in the graph, we'll use modularity-based community detection or clustering of connected components, as this graph structure indicates a likely presence of distinct communities.

Here is the JSON response:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

Explanation:
Through analysis of the graph's edge list, the nodes seem to cluster into four communities based on their connectivity:
1. Nodes centered around {0, 1, 2, ..., 7}.
2. Nodes centered around {8, 9, 10, ..., 14}.
3. Nodes centered around {15, 16, 17, ..., 21}.
4. Nodes centered around {22, 23, 24, ..., 28}.

These communities are determined by examining groups of nodes that are densely connected among themselves but sparsely connected to other groups.
