To determine the number of communities in a graph with a community structure, we can analyze the connected components. Hereâ€™s the result for your graph:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
``` 

Explanation:
The graph consists of two disconnected subgraphs (two communities):
1. Nodes primarily connected around 0 (first community).
2. Nodes primarily connected around 13 (second community).
