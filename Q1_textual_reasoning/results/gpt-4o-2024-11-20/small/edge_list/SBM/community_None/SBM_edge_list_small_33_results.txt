To determine the number of communities in the provided graph, I will analyze the structure of the graph. Given that it seems to have community clusters, I will count the number of connected components in the graph.

Upon manual analysis, the graph can be split into two distinct connected components:
1. The first component has nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.
2. The second component has nodes: {11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}.

Thus, there are **2 communities**.

Here is the JSON response:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
