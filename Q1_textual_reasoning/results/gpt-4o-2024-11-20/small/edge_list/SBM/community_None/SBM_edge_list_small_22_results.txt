To count the number of communities in the graph, we will rely on detecting connected components. Each connected component in an undirected graph represents a community.

Analyzing the provided edge list, we process the graph to find these communities.

Here's the JSON response:

```json
{
  "answer": 5
}
```

Explanation:
The edge list represents connections between nodes. After processing the graph:
1. Nodes connected via edges `(0-5)` form one community.
2. Nodes connected via edges `(6-11)` form another community.
3. Nodes connected via edges `(12-17)` form another community.
4. Nodes connected via edges `(18-22)` form another community.
5. Nodes connected via edges `(23-27)` form another community.
