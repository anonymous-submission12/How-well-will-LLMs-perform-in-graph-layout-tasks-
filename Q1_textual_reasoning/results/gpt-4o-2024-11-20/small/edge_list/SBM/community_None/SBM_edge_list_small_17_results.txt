To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm. Based on the provided edge list, the graph appears to have distinct clusters of nodes. Using a connected components approach (since the graph is undirected), we can count the number of connected subgraphs, which correspond to the communities.

Here is the result:
