To identify the number of communities in the graph, we will rely on community detection algorithms, such as connected components or modularity optimization methods. Here, I assume the graph represents an undirected graph, and we calculate the number of connected components to determine the communities.

Upon analyzing the given edge list, the graph consists of the following connected components:
1. Nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}
2. Nodes {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 29, 23}
3. Nodes {10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 28, 26}
4. Nodes {15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
5. Nodes {20, 21, 22, 23, 24}
6. Nodes {25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Thus, there are 6 distinct communities.
