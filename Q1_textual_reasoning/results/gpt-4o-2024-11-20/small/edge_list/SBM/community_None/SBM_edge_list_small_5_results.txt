To count the number of communities in the given graph, we will use a graph clustering algorithm such as connected components or modularity-based community detection to determine the distinct communities.

Here's the Python-based analysis of the graph structure and the result in JSON format:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

This means there are 4 communities present in the provided graph.
