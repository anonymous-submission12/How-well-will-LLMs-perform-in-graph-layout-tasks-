To analyze the number of communities in the graph, we need to identify closely interconnected groups of nodes. Based on the edge list provided, the graph appears to have clusters or community structures, with nodes densely connected within clusters and sparsely connected between clusters.

Here, we observe three main groups of nodes based on the connectivity patterns:
1. `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`
2. `{7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}`
3. `{14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}`

These three clusters are disjoint and appear to form separate communities.
