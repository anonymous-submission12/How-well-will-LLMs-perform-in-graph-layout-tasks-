To identify the number of communities in a graph, we typically use community detection algorithms, such as the Clauset-Newman-Moore modularity maximization or other techniques depending on the specifics of the graph structure. 

Here, I will assume this graph has a clear community structure and count the number of distinct groups of nodes that are closely connected within the graph. Due to the mix of node connections, we can perform an analysis based on clustering.

Based on the provided edges, the graph has three distinct groups:

1. **Nodes 0 to 13 (interconnected closely)**
2. **Nodes 14 to 20 (forming another connected group)**

Thus, the graph has **2 communities**.
