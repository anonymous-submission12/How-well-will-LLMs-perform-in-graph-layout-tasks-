To find the number of communities in the graph provided via its edge list, we can analyze the connected components of the graph. Each connected component represents a community. Here's the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
``` 

Explanation: Based on the provided edge list, the graph has three distinct connected components (or communities):
1. Community 1: Nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 19}
2. Community 2: Nodes {7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
3. Community 3: Nodes {14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}
