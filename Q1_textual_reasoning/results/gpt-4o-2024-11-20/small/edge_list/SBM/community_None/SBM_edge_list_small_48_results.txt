To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the "Louvain method" or "Girvan-Newman algorithm." These algorithms identify clusters or communities within a graph based on the structure of connections.

From the edge list provided, the graph appears to have two distinct clusters or communities based on the connectivity of nodes. The first community includes nodes primarily connected around node `0`, and the second community includes nodes connected around node `13`.

Thus, the graph has **2 communities**.
