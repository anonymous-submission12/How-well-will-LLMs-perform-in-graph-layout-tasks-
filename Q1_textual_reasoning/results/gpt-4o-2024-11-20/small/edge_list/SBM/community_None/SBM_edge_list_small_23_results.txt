To identify the number of communities in the given graph, I will analyze the connectivity of nodes in the provided edge list. Based on the structure, there are two distinct communities: one containing nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20}, and another containing nodes {11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}. Both sets are connected internally but not externally (except for node 20, which connects to both sets). We would consider it two communities due to modular structure distinctness.
