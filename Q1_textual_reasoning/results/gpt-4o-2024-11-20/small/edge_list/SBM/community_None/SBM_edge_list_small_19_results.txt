To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can analyze the edge list and identify connected components. Each connected component represents a community. Based on the provided edge list, the graph has four distinct communities:

1. Nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14}
2. Nodes {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18}
3. Nodes {15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 25}
4. Nodes {22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28}

Thus, the number of communities is 4.
