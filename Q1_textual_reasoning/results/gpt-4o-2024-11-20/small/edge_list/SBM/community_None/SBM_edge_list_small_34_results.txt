To determine the number of communities in the graph, one can use community detection algorithms like the Girvan-Newman algorithm, modularity maximization, or other methods that identify connected components or tightly-knit groups within the graph. Given the graph edge list data, I will calculate the number of communities based on connected components since the graph implies a community structure. Below is the answer:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
``` 

Explanation: The graph appears to have 3 clusters or communities based on edge connections:
1. Nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 17}.
2. Nodes {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.
3. Nodes {11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20}.
