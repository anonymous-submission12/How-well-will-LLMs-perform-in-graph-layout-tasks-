To count the number of nodes in the graph, we need to identify all unique nodes present in the edge list. Here's the calculation:

The edge list provided is:
```
[(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 16), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 11), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 27), (5, 16), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (9, 10), (9, 11), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 16), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 17), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (15, 16), (15, 17), (16, 17), (16, 19), (18, 19), (18, 21), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 22), (20, 21), (20, 22), (23, 27), (24, 26), (24, 27), (25, 26), (25, 27), (26, 27)]
```

Extracting all unique nodes from the edge list:
```
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27}
```

The total number of unique nodes is **28**.

Here is the JSON response:
