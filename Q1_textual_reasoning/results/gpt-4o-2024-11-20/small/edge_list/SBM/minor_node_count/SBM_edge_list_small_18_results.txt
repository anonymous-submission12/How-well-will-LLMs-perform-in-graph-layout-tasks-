To determine the number of nodes in the graph represented as an edge list, we need to extract all the unique nodes from the edges. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 29
}
```

Explanation:
The edge list includes pairs of nodes. After extracting all unique nodes from the edge list, we find that there are **29 unique nodes** in the graph (0 to 28).
