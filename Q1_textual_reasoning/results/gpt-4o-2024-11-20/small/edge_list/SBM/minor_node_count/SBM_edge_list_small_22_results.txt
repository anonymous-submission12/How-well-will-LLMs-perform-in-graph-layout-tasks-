To count the number of nodes in the graph, we need to identify all unique nodes from the edge list. Here's the calculation:

The edge list provided is:
```
[(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 11), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 11), (6, 13), (7, 10), (7, 11), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), (12, 13), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17), (13, 15), (13, 17), (13, 25), (14, 15), (14, 17), (15, 16), (15, 17), (15, 22), (16, 17), (18, 19), (18, 21), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 21), (20, 22), (23, 24), (23, 25), (23, 26), (23, 27), (24, 25), (24, 26), (24, 27), (25, 26), (25, 27), (26, 27)]
```

Extracting all unique nodes:
```
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27}
```

The total number of unique nodes is **28**.

Here is the JSON response:
