To determine the number of nodes in the graph, we can extract all unique nodes from the edge list. Here's the computation:

The unique nodes are: `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25}`.

Count of these unique nodes: **26**

Here is the JSON response:

```json
{
  "answer": 26
}
```
