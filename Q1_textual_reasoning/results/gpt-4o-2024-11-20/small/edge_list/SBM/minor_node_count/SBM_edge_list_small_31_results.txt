To count the number of nodes in the graph, we can collect all unique nodes present in the edge list. Let's compute the result.

The edge list provided is:
```
[(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), ..., (25, 26), (25, 27), (26, 27)]
```

The unique nodes are extracted from both ends of all edges. After computation, the unique nodes include numbers ranging from `0` to `27`, yielding a total of `28` nodes.

Here is the JSON response:

```json
{
  "answer": 28
}
