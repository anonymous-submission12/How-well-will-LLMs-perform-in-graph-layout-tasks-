To count the number of nodes in the graph, we'll extract all unique nodes from the edge list provided. 

Here's the calculation and response:

```json
{
  "answer": 21
}
```  

Explanation:  
The edge list contains pairs of nodes representing edges. To find the total nodes, we take all unique integers across all pairs from the edge list. The nodes are:  
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}, which gives a total of 21 nodes.
