To calculate the shortest path between node '11' and '3', we observe that the graph is represented as an edge list. All nodes are directly connected to node '0', forming a star topology. Therefore, the shortest path between any two nodes in this graph passes through node '0'.

The shortest path from node '11' to node '3' is:
- From node '11' to node '0' (1 step).
- From node '0' to node '3' (1 step).

Thus, the total length of the shortest path is 2.
