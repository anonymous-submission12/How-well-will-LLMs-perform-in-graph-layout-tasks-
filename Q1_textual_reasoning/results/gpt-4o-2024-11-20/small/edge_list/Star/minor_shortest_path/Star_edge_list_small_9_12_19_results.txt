To calculate the shortest path between nodes '12' and '19', we can analyze the given graph. The graph is represented as an edge list, and it shows that all nodes (1 through 28) are directly connected to node '0'. This means the graph is a star graph with node '0' as the central node.

In a star graph, the shortest path between any two non-central nodes (e.g., '12' and '19') is always 2, as the path goes through the central node ('0').
