To calculate the shortest path between nodes '8' and '20', let's analyze the graph represented by the edge list. The graph is a star graph where node '0' is the central node connected to all other nodes. Therefore, the shortest path between any two nodes (e.g., '8' and '20') is through the central node '0'.

The shortest path from '8' to '20' is:
- From '8' to '0' (1 step)
- From '0' to '20' (1 step)

Thus, the total length of the shortest path is 2.
