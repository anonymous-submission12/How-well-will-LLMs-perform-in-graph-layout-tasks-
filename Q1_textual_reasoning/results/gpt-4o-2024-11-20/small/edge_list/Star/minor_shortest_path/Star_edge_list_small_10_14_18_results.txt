The graph provided is structured as a star graph where node `0` is the central node connected to all other nodes. Given this structure, the shortest path between any two non-central nodes must route through the central node (`0`).

To calculate the shortest path between node `14` and node `18`:
1. The path from node `14` to node `0` has a length of `1`.
2. The path from node `0` to node `18` has a length of `1`.

Thus, the shortest path length between node `14` and node `18` is `1 + 1 = 2`.
