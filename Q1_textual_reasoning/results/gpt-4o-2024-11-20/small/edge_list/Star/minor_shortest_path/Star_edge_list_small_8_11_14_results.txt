To calculate the shortest path between nodes '11' and '14', let's analyze the graph. The graph is represented as an edge list, and all nodes are directly connected to node '0'. This means the graph is a star graph with node '0' as the center.

In a star graph, the shortest path between any two non-central nodes (e.g., '11' and '14') passes through the central node ('0'). Therefore, the shortest path between '11' and '14' is:

- From '11' to '0' (1 edge)
- From '0' to '14' (1 edge)

Thus, the total length of the shortest path is 2.
