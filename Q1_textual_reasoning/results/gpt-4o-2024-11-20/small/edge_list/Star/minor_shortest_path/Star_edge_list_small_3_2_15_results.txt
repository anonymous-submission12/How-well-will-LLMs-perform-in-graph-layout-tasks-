To calculate the shortest path between nodes "2" and "15" in the given graph, we can use breadth-first search (BFS). The graph is represented as an edge list, which indicates that every node from 1 to 22 is connected to node 0. This forms a star-like structure where node 0 is at the center, and all other nodes are directly connected to it.

Shortest path analysis:
1. Node "2" is directly connected to node "0".
2. Node "15" is also directly connected to node "0".
3. The shortest path between "2" and "15" traverses through "0".

Thus, the shortest path length is 2: **2 -> 0 -> 15**.
