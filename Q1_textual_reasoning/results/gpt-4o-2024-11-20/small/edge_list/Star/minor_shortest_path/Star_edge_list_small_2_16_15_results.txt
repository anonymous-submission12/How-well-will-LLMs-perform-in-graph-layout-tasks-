To calculate the shortest path between nodes '16' and '15', let's analyze the graph represented by the edge list. The graph is a star graph where node '0' is the central node connected to all other nodes (1 through 21). In a star graph, the shortest path between any two non-central nodes always passes through the central node.

Thus, the shortest path between node '16' and node '15' is:
- From '16' to '0' (1 edge)
- From '0' to '15' (1 edge)

The total length of the shortest path is 2.
