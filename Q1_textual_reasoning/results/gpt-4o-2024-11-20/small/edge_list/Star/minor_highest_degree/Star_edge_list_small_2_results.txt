To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. Here's the solution:

1. Node `0` is connected to all other nodes in the graph, so its degree is equal to the number of edges.
2. All other nodes are connected only to node `0`, so their degree is `1`.

The highest degree in the graph is the degree of node `0`, which is `21` (since there are 21 edges connected to it).

Here is the JSON response:
