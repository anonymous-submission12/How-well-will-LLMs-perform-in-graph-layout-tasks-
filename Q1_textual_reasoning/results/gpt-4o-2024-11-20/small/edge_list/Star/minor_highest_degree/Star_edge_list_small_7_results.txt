To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.

Here is the calculation:

- Node `0` is connected to all other nodes in the graph (nodes `1` through `26`), so its degree is `26`.
- All other nodes (`1` through `26`) are only connected to node `0`, so their degree is `1`.

The highest degree in the graph is `26`, which belongs to node `0`.

Here is the JSON response:

  "answer": 26
