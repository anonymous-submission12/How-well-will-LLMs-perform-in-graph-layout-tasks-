To calculate the highest degree of nodes in the graph based on the provided edge list, I will determine the number of connections each node has. Here is the result in JSON format:

```json
{
  "answer": 28
}
```

### Explanation:
- Node `0` appears in every edge of the list, connecting to nodes `1` through `28`. This means node `0` has a degree of `28`.
- All other nodes (`1` through `28`) each connect only to node `0`, giving them a degree of `1`.
- The highest degree among all nodes is `28`.
