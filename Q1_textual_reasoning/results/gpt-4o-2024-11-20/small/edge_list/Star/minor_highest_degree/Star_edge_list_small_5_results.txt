To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. Here's the solution:

The given edge list is:
```
[(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 12), (0, 13), (0, 14), (0, 15), (0, 16), (0, 17), (0, 18), (0, 19), (0, 20), (0, 21), (0, 22), (0, 23), (0, 24)]
```

From this, we can see that node `0` is connected to all other nodes (1 through 24). Therefore, the degree of node `0` is `24`. All other nodes (1 through 24) are connected only to node `0`, so their degree is `1`.

The highest degree in the graph is `24`.
