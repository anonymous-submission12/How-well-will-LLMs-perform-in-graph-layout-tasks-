To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. The degree of a node is the number of edges it is part of.

From the given edge list, we can see that node `0` is connected to all other nodes (`1` through `27`). Therefore, the degree of node `0` is `27`. All other nodes (`1` through `27`) are connected only to node `0`, so their degree is `1`.

The highest degree in the graph is `27`.

Here is the JSON response:
