To determine the shortest path between node `0` and node `22`, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm since the graph is unweighted. Here's the computation:

### Step 1: Represent the graph.
The graph can be represented as an adjacency list based on the provided edge list:
```python
{
    0: [1, 7],
    1: [0, 2, 8],
    2: [1, 3, 9],
    3: [2, 4, 10],
    4: [3, 5, 11],
    5: [4, 6, 12],
    6: [5, 13],
    7: [0, 8, 14],
    8: [1, 7, 9, 15],
    9: [2, 8, 10, 16],
    10: [3, 9, 11, 17],
    11: [4, 10, 12, 18],
    12: [5, 11, 13, 19],
    13: [6, 12, 20],
    14: [7, 15, 21],
    15: [8, 14, 16, 22],
    16: [9, 15, 17, 23],
    17: [10, 16, 18, 24],
    18: [11, 17, 19, 25],
    19: [12, 18, 20, 26],
    20: [13, 19, 27],
    21: [14, 22],
    22: [15, 21, 23],
    23: [16, 22, 24],
    24: [17, 23, 25],
    25: [18, 24, 26],
    26: [19, 25, 27],
    27: [20, 26]
}
```

### Step 2: Use BFS to find the shortest path.
Starting from node `0`, BFS traverses level by level to find the shortest path to node `22`. Here's the traversal:

1. Start at node `0`.
2. Visit its neighbors `1` and `7`.
3. Visit their neighbors `2`, `8`, `14` (and so forth) until reaching node `22`.

After calculating (details omitted for brevity), the shortest path length is **4** (e.g., `0 -> 7 -> 14 -> 15 -> 22`).

### Final Output:
```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```
