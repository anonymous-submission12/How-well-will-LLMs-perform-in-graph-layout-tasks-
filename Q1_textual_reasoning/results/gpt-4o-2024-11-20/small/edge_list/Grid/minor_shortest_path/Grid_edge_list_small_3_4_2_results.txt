To calculate the shortest path between node '4' and node '2', we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm since the graph is unweighted. Here's the solution:

1. The graph is represented as an edge list.
2. We'll construct an adjacency list from the edge list.
3. Using BFS, we'll find the shortest path between node '4' and node '2'.

### Solution:

The shortest path between node '4' and node '2' is as follows:
- Path: 4 → 3 → 2
- Length: 2
