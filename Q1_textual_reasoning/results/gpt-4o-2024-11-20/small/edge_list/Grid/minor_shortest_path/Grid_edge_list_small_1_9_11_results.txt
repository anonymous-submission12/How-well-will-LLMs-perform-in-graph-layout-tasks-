To calculate the shortest path between nodes '9' and '11', we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm since the graph is unweighted. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph is represented as an edge list.
- Starting from node '9', the shortest path to node '11' is:
  - 9 → 8 → 7 → 6 → 11
- This path has a length of 4 edges.
