To calculate the shortest path between nodes `16` and `11`, we can represent the graph as an adjacency list and then use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path, as it is efficient for unweighted graphs.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 5
}
``` 

Explanation:
- Path: `16 -> 15 -> 14 -> 13 -> 12 -> 11`
- The length of this path is `5`.
