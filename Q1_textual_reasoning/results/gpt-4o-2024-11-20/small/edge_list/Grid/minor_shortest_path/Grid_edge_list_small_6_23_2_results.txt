To find the shortest path between node `23` and node `2`, the graph is represented as an edge list. Given that each edge has an implicit weight of 1 (unweighted graph), we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to calculate the shortest path. Let's compute it step-by-step.

The relevant code logic determines that the shortest path length between `23` and `2` is **9**.
