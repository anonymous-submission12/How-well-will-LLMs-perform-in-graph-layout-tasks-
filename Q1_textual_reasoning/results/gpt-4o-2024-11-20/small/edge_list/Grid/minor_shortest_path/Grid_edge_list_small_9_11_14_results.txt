To calculate the shortest path between nodes '11' and '14', we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm since the graph is unweighted. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

### Explanation:
1. The graph is represented as an edge list.
2. Using BFS, we start from node '11' and explore its neighbors level by level until we reach node '14'.
3. The shortest path from '11' to '14' is: 11 → 10 → 9 → 8 → 7 → 14, which has a length of 4.
