To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of edges connected to each node and find the maximum among them.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 6
}
```

### Explanation:
1. Parse the edge list to count the degree of each node.
2. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.
3. After processing the edge list, the node with the highest degree is found to have a degree of 6.
