To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of edges connected to each node and find the maximum among them.

Here is the solution:

1. Parse the edge list to count the degree of each node.
2. Find the maximum degree.

### Calculation:
- The graph is represented as an edge list.
- Each edge `(u, v)` contributes to the degree of both nodes `u` and `v`.

### Result:
The highest degree in the graph is **4**, which occurs for nodes in the middle of the grid-like structure (e.g., node 16).
