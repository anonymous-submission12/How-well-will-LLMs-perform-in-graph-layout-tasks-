To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of edges connected to each node and find the maximum value. Here's the solution:

1. Process the edge list to calculate the degree of each node.
2. Identify the maximum degree.

Here is the JSON output:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

Explanation:  
The graph provided in the edge list connects nodes, forming a structure where some nodes have higher degrees than others. After calculating the degree for each node, nodes like `1`, `2`, `3` (and others with similar properties) are connected to four edges, making the highest degree in this graph equal to `4`.
