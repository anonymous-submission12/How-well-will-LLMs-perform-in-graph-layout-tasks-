To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of edges connected to each node and find the maximum among them.

Here is the solution:

1. Parse the edge list.
2. Count the degree of each node.
3. Find the maximum degree.

### Calculation:
- The graph is represented as an edge list: `[(0, 1), (0, 8), (1, 2), ...]`.
- For each edge `(u, v)`, increment the degree count for both `u` and `v`.

### Result:
The highest degree of any node in the graph is **6**.

  "answer": 6
