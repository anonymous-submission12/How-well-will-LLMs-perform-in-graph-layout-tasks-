To determine the highest degree of a node in the given graph, let's first calculate the degree of each node. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. The given graph in edge list format is:

`[(0, 1), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 8), (4, 9), (5, 6), (5, 10), (6, 7), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 12), (8, 9), (8, 13), (9, 14), (10, 11), (10, 15), (11, 12), (11, 16), (12, 13), (12, 17), (13, 14), (13, 18), (14, 19), (15, 16), (15, 20), (16, 17), (16, 21), (17, 18), (17, 22), (18, 19), (18, 23), (19, 24), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24)]`

### Step-by-step Calculation
1. Count the number of edges connected to each node.
2. Identify the node with the highest degree.

### Node Degrees:
- **Node 0**: 2 (connected to 1, 5)
- **Node 1**: 3 (connected to 0, 2, 6)
- **Node 2**: 4 (connected to 1, 3, 7, 6)
- **Node 3**: 4 (connected to 2, 4, 8, 7)
- **Node 4**: 3 (connected to 3, 9, 8)
- **Node 5**: 3 (connected to 0, 6, 10)
- **Node 6**: 5 (connected to 1, 5, 7, 11, 2)
- **Node 7**: 5 (connected to 2, 6, 8, 12, 3)
- **Node 8**: 5 (connected to 3, 7, 9, 13, 4)
- **Node 9**: 3 (connected to 4, 8, 14)
- **Node 10**: 3 (connected to 5, 11, 15)
- **Node 11**: 5 (connected to 6, 10, 12, 16, 7)
- **Node 12**: 5 (connected to 7, 11, 13, 17, 8)
- **Node 13**: 5 (connected to 8, 12, 14, 18, 9)
- **Node 14**: 3 (connected to 9, 13, 19)
- **Node 15**: 3 (connected to 10, 16, 20)
- **Node 16**: 5 (connected to 11, 15, 17, 21, 12)
- **Node 17**: 5 (connected to 12, 16, 18, 22, 13)
- **Node 18**: 5 (connected to 13, 17, 19, 23, 14)
- **Node 19**: 3 (connected to 14, 18, 24)
- **Node 20**: 2 (connected to 15, 21)
- **Node 21**: 3 (connected to 16, 20, 22)
- **Node 22**: 3 (connected to 17, 21, 23)
- **Node 23**: 3 (connected to 18, 22, 24)
- **Node 24**: 2 (connected to 19, 23)

### Highest Degree:
The highest degree of any node is **5** (Nodes 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, and 18).
