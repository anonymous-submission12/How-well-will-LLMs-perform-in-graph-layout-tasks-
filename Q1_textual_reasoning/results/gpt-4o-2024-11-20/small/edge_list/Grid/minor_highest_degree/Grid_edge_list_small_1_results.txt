To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the provided graph, we need to find how many edges are connected to each node and determine the maximum.

The edge_list representation of the graph shows the connections between nodes. Here's the calculation:

1. Count the occurrences of each node in the edge list.
2. Determine the maximum degree.

Let me compute the result for you.
