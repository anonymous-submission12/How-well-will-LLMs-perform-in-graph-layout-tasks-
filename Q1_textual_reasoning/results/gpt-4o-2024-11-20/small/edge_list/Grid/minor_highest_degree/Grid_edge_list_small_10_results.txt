To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph is represented as an edge list.
- The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.
- After analyzing the edge list, the nodes with the highest degree (e.g., nodes 11, 12, 13, etc.) have 4 edges connected to them.
