To solve this, let us calculate the degree of each node in the given graph and determine the highest degree.

### Steps:
1. Parse the edge list: Each tuple `(u, v)` indicates an edge between nodes `u` and `v`.
2. Create a degree dictionary where each node keeps track of its connections.
3. Iterate through the edge list, incrementing the degree for each node involved in an edge.
4. Find the maximum degree value in the degree dictionary.

### Calculation:
- The given edge list is `[(0, 1), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 8), (2, 3), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 10), (4, 5), (4, 11), (5, 6), (5, 12), (6, 13), (7, 8), (7, 14), (8, 9), (8, 15), (9, 10), (9, 16), (10, 11), (10, 17), (11, 12), (11, 18), (12, 13), (12, 19), (13, 20), (14, 15), (14, 21), (15, 16), (15, 22), (16, 17), (16, 23), (17, 18), (17, 24), (18, 19), (18, 25), (19, 20), (19, 26), (20, 27), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26), (26, 27)]`.
- Using this edge list, iterating to compute degrees gives:

```
Degree of each node:
{
  0: 2,  1: 3,  2: 3,  3: 3,  4: 3,
  5: 3,  6: 2,  7: 3,  8: 4,  9: 4,
 10: 4, 11: 4, 12: 4, 13: 3, 14: 3,
 15: 4, 16: 4, 17: 4, 18: 4, 19: 4,
 20: 3, 21: 2, 22: 3, 23: 3, 24: 3,
 25: 3, 26: 3, 27: 2
}
```

- The maximum degree is `4`.
