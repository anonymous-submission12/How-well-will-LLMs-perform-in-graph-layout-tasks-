To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of edges connected to each node. Here's the solution:

### Steps:
1. Parse the edge list to count the degree of each node.
2. Find the maximum degree among all nodes.

### Calculation:
The graph is represented as an edge list:
```
[(0, 1), (0, 14), (1, 2), (1, 15), (2, 3), (2, 16), (3, 4), (3, 17), (4, 5), (4, 18), (5, 6), (5, 19), (6, 7), (6, 20), (7, 8), (7, 21), (8, 9), (8, 22), (9, 10), (9, 23), (10, 11), (10, 24), (11, 12), (11, 25), (12, 13), (12, 26), (13, 27), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26), (26, 27)]
```

We count the degree of each node:
- Node `0` has degree `2` (connected to `1` and `14`).
- Node `1` has degree `3` (connected to `0`, `2`, and `15`).
- Node `2` has degree `3` (connected to `1`, `3`, and `16`).
- Node `3` has degree `3` (connected to `2`, `4`, and `17`).
- Node `4` has degree `3` (connected to `3`, `5`, and `18`).
- Node `5` has degree `3` (connected to `4`, `6`, and `19`).
- Node `6` has degree `3` (connected to `5`, `7`, and `20`).
- Node `7` has degree `3` (connected to `6`, `8`, and `21`).
- Node `8` has degree `3` (connected to `7`, `9`, and `22`).
- Node `9` has degree `3` (connected to `8`, `10`, and `23`).
- Node `10` has degree `3` (connected to `9`, `11`, and `24`).
- Node `11` has degree `3` (connected to `10`, `12`, and `25`).
- Node `12` has degree `3` (connected to `11`, `13`, and `26`).
- Node `13` has degree `2` (connected to `12` and `27`).
- Node `14` has degree `2` (connected to `0` and `15`).
- Node `15` has degree `3` (connected to `1`, `14`, and `16`).
- Node `16` has degree `3` (connected to `2`, `15`, and `17`).
- Node `17` has degree `3` (connected to `3`, `16`, and `18`).
- Node `18` has degree `3` (connected to `4`, `17`, and `19`).
- Node `19` has degree `3` (connected to `5`, `18`, and `20`).
- Node `20` has degree `3` (connected to `6`, `19`, and `21`).
- Node `21` has degree `3` (connected to `7`, `20`, and `22`).
- Node `22` has degree `3` (connected to `8`, `21`, and `23`).
- Node `23` has degree `3` (connected to `9`, `22`, and `24`).
- Node `24` has degree `3` (connected to `10`, `23`, and `25`).
- Node `25` has degree `3` (connected to `11`, `24`, and `26`).
- Node `26` has degree `3` (connected to `12`, `25`, and `27`).
- Node `27` has degree `2` (connected to `13` and `26`).

The highest degree is `3`.
