To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph is represented as an edge list.
- The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.
- After analyzing the edge list, the nodes with the highest degree are nodes 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, each having a degree of 4.
