To solve the problem, we need to calculate the degree of each node in the graph represented by the edge list. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to that node. The highest degree is the maximum degree value among all the nodes.

Here is the calculation:

1. Parse the edge list to count the occurrence of nodes (since each occurrence contributes to the degree of the node).
2. Determine the maximum degree among all the nodes.

### Calculation:

The edge list is:
```plaintext
[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24)]
```

We observe the graph structure is a path, so the degrees are:
- Nodes in the middle (e.g., 1 through 23) have degree 2.
- The two endpoints (0 and 24) have degree 1.

The highest degree is **2** (for nodes in the middle).
