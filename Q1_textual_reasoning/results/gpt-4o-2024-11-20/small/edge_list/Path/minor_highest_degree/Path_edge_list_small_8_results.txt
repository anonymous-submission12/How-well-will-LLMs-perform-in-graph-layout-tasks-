To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. Here's the calculation:

1. Parse the edge list.
2. Count the occurrences of each node in the edge list.
3. Find the maximum count (degree).

The graph is a linear chain, so each node except the endpoints will have a degree of 2, and the endpoints will have a degree of 1.

The highest degree in this graph is **2**.
