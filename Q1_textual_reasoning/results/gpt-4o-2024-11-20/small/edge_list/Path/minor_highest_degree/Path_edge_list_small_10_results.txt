To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of edges connected to each node and find the maximum among them.

The given graph is represented as an edge list. Each edge connects two nodes. Let's calculate the degree of each node:

1. Parse the edge list.
2. Count the number of edges connected to each node.
3. Find the maximum degree.

Here is the result:

  "answer": 2
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph is a linear chain (a path graph) where each node (except the endpoints) is connected to exactly two other nodes.
- The endpoints (nodes 0 and 29) have a degree of 1.
- All other nodes have a degree of 2.
- Therefore, the highest degree in the graph is 2.
