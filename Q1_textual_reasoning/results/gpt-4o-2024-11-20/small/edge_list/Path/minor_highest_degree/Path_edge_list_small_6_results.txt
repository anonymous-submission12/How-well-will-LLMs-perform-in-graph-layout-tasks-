To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. Here's the calculation:

1. The graph is represented as an edge list.
2. Each edge connects two nodes, so we count the occurrences of each node in the edge list.

The graph provided is a linear chain, where each node (except the first and last) is connected to exactly two other nodes. The first and last nodes are connected to only one other node.

The highest degree in this graph is 2.

Here is the JSON response:
