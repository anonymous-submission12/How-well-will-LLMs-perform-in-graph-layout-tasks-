To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. Here's the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph is a linear chain (path graph) where each node (except the endpoints) is connected to exactly two other nodes.
- The endpoints (nodes 0 and 28) have a degree of 1, while all other nodes have a degree of 2.
- Therefore, the highest degree in the graph is 2.
