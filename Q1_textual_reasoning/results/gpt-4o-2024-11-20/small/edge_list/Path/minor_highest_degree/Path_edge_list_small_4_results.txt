To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph represented as an edge list, we need to count the number of connections (edges) for each node. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.

Here’s the step-by-step solution:

1. Parse the edge list.
2. Count the degree of each node based on its connections in the edge list.
3. Identify the node with the maximum degree.

Now, let’s calculate:

The edge list provided:
`[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23)]`

This graph is essentially a linear structure (a path graph), where each node (except for the first and last ones) is connected to two other nodes.

- Node 0 has degree 1 (connected to node 1).
- Node 23 has degree 1 (connected to node 22).
- All other nodes (from 1 to 22) have degree 2 (connected to one predecessor and one successor).

Thus, the highest degree in the graph is 2.

The JSON answer is as follows:
