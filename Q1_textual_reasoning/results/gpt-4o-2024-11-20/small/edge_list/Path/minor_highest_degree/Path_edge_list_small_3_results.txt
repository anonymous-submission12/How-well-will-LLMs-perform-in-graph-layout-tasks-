To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of edges connected to each node and identify the node with the maximum degree.

The given graph data is:

```[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22)]```

This graph is a linear chain where each internal node connects to two other nodes, and the nodes at the ends connect to just one other node. Let us evaluate the degrees:

- Nodes at the edges (0 and 22): Degree = 1
- All other nodes (1 through 21): Degree = 2

Thus, the highest degree is 2.
