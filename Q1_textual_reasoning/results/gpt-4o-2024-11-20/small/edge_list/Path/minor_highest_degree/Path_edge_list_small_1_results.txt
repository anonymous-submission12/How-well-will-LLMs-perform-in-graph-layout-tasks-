To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of edges connected to each node and find the maximum among them.

The given graph is represented as an edge list:
```
[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20)]
```

This graph is a linear chain, where each node (except the endpoints) is connected to two other nodes. The endpoints (nodes 0 and 20) are connected to only one other node.

### Steps:
1. Count the degree of each node by iterating through the edge list.
2. Find the maximum degree.

### Calculation:
- Nodes 0 and 20 have a degree of 1 (each connected to one other node).
- All other nodes (1 through 19) have a degree of 2 (each connected to two other nodes).

Thus, the highest degree in the graph is **2**.
