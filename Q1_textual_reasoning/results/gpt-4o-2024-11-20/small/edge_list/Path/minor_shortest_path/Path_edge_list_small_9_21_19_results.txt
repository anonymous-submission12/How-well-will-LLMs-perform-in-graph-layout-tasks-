To calculate the shortest path between nodes '21' and '19', we can observe that the graph is a simple linear chain. The shortest path is the direct path along the chain, and the distance is the absolute difference between the node numbers.

The shortest path length between node '21' and '19' is:

\[
|21 - 19| = 2
\]
