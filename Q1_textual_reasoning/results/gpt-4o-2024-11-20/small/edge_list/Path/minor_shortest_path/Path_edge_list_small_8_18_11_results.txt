To calculate the shortest path between node '18' and node '11', we can observe that the graph is a simple linear chain. The shortest path is the number of edges between the two nodes. Since the nodes are connected sequentially, the shortest path length is the absolute difference between the two node numbers.

The shortest path length between node '18' and node '11' is:

\[
|18 - 11| = 7
\]
