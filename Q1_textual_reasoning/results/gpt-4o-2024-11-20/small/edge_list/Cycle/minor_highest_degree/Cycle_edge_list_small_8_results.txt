To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the given graph represented by an edge list:

1. We'll iterate through the edges and count the number of times each node appears (degree).
2. Then, find the maximum among the degrees of all nodes.

The graph edges are: 
```
[(0, 1), (0, 27), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26), (26, 27)].
```

### Observation:
Each edge `(x, y)` contributes 1 to the degree of node `x` and 1 to the degree of node `y`. Let's calculate the degrees.

### Calculation:
- Node `0` connects to nodes `1` and `27`. Degree = 2
- Nodes `1` to `26` connect to exactly 2 other nodes each. Degree = 2
- Node `27` connects to nodes `0` and `26`. Degree = 2

Thus, all nodes have a degree of 2.

### Result:
The highest degree in the graph is `2`.
