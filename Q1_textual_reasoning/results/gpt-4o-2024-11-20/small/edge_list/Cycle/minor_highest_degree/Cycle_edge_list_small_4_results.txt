To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. Here's the calculation:

### Step 1: Count the degree of each node
The graph is represented as an edge list:
```
[(0, 1), (0, 23), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23)]
```

We will count the degree of each node by iterating through the edge list.

### Step 2: Degree Calculation
- Node `0` is connected to `1` and `23` → Degree = 2
- Node `1` is connected to `0` and `2` → Degree = 2
- Node `2` is connected to `1` and `3` → Degree = 2
- Node `3` is connected to `2` and `4` → Degree = 2
- Node `4` is connected to `3` and `5` → Degree = 2
- Node `5` is connected to `4` and `6` → Degree = 2
- Node `6` is connected to `5` and `7` → Degree = 2
- Node `7` is connected to `6` and `8` → Degree = 2
- Node `8` is connected to `7` and `9` → Degree = 2
- Node `9` is connected to `8` and `10` → Degree = 2
- Node `10` is connected to `9` and `11` → Degree = 2
- Node `11` is connected to `10` and `12` → Degree = 2
- Node `12` is connected to `11` and `13` → Degree = 2
- Node `13` is connected to `12` and `14` → Degree = 2
- Node `14` is connected to `13` and `15` → Degree = 2
- Node `15` is connected to `14` and `16` → Degree = 2
- Node `16` is connected to `15` and `17` → Degree = 2
- Node `17` is connected to `16` and `18` → Degree = 2
- Node `18` is connected to `17` and `19` → Degree = 2
- Node `19` is connected to `18` and `20` → Degree = 2
- Node `20` is connected to `19` and `21` → Degree = 2
- Node `21` is connected to `20` and `22` → Degree = 2
- Node `22` is connected to `21` and `23` → Degree = 2
- Node `23` is connected to `0` and `22` → Degree = 2

### Step 3: Find the highest degree
The degree of all nodes is `2`. Therefore, the highest degree is `2`.
