To calculate the highest degree of a node in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node and find the maximum value among them.

### Steps:
1. Parse the edge list.
2. Count the occurrences of each node in the edge list.
3. Determine the node with the highest degree.

Let's compute this:

### Edge List Analysis:
- Each pair `(a, b)` represents an edge connecting nodes `a` and `b`.
- Nodes 0 and 22 appear more than once in the edge list.

### Node Degree:
The degrees of nodes can be calculated:
- Node `0` has a degree of 2 (connected to nodes 1 and 22).
- Node `1` has a degree of 2 (connected to nodes 0 and 2).
- Similarly, nodes `2` through `21` each have a degree of 2, as they are part of a linear chain.
- Node `22` has a degree of 2 (connected to nodes 0 and 21).

Thus, the highest degree is **2**.
