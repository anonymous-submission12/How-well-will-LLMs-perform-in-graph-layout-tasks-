To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the given graph, we count the number of edges connected to each node (degree) and find the maximum.

### Step-by-step:
1. Parse the edge list.
2. Track how many edges are connected to each node.
3. Determine which node has the highest degree.

After processing the given edge list `[(0, 1), (0, 28), (1, 2), ..., (27, 28)]`, here is the result:
