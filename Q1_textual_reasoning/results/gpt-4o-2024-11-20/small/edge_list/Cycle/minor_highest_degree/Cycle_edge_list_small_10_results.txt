To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. Here's the calculation:

1. Parse the edge list.
2. Count the occurrences of each node in the edge list.
3. Find the maximum count.

The graph data is represented as an edge list:  
`[(0, 1), (0, 29), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26), (26, 27), (27, 28), (28, 29)]`.

### Calculation:
- Node `0` appears in edges `(0, 1)` and `(0, 29)`, so its degree is `2`.
- Nodes `1` and `29` each appear in `2` edges.
- All other nodes (`2` through `28`) appear in exactly `2` edges.

Thus, the highest degree of all nodes in the graph is `2`.
