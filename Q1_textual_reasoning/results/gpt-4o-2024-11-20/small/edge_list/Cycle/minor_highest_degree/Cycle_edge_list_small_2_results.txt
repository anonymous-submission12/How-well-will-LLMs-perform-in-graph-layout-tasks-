To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of edges connected to each node and find the maximum among them.

Here is the solution:

1. Parse the edge list.
2. Count the degree of each node.
3. Find the maximum degree.

The graph data is represented as an edge list:
```
[(0, 1), (0, 21), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21)]
```

From this, we can calculate the degree of each node:
- Node `0` is connected to nodes `1` and `21`, so its degree is `2`.
- Node `1` is connected to nodes `0` and `2`, so its degree is `2`.
- Node `21` is connected to nodes `0` and `20`, so its degree is `2`.
- All other nodes (from `2` to `20`) are connected to exactly two other nodes, so their degree is also `2`.

Thus, the highest degree of any node in the graph is `2`.
