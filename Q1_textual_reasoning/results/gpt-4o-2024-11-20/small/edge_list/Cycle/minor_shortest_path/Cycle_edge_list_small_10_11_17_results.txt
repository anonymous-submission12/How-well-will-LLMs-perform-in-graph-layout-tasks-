To calculate the shortest path between nodes '11' and '17', we can observe that the graph is a linear chain of nodes. The shortest path between two nodes in such a graph is simply the difference in their indices.

The shortest path between node '11' and node '17' is:

```
|17 - 11| = 6
```

Here is the JSON response:

```json
{
  "answer": 6
}
```
