To calculate the shortest path between node '1' and node '9', we can observe that the graph is a simple linear chain. The nodes are connected sequentially, and the shortest path between any two nodes is the direct traversal along the chain.

The shortest path from node '1' to node '9' involves traversing the edges:
- (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9)

This path consists of 8 edges.
