To calculate the shortest path between nodes '8' and '13', we can observe that the graph is a linear chain of nodes. The shortest path between two nodes in such a graph is simply the difference in their indices.

The shortest path between node '8' and node '13' is:

\[
|13 - 8| = 5
\]

Here is the JSON response:

```json
{
  "answer": 5
}
