To calculate the shortest path between node '9' and node '20', we can observe that the graph is a simple cycle. The shortest path can be calculated by traversing the nodes either clockwise or counterclockwise. 

From node '9' to node '20', the shortest path is:
- Clockwise: 9 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 13 → 14 → 15 → 16 → 17 → 18 → 19 → 20 (11 steps)
- Counterclockwise: 9 → 8 → 7 → 6 → 5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 0 → 21 → 20 (12 steps)

The shortest path is the clockwise direction, which is 11 steps.
