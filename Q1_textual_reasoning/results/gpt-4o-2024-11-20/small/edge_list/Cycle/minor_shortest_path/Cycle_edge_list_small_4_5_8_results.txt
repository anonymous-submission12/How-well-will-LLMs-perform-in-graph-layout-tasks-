To calculate the shortest path between node '5' and node '8', we can observe that the graph is a linear chain of nodes. The shortest path is simply the number of edges between the two nodes.

From the edge list provided, the nodes are connected sequentially:
- Node '5' connects to node '6'.
- Node '6' connects to node '7'.
- Node '7' connects to node '8'.

Thus, the shortest path between node '5' and node '8' consists of 3 edges.
