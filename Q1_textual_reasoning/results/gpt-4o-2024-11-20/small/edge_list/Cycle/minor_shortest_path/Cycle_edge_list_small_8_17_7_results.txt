To calculate the shortest path distance between nodes '17' and '7', first observe that the given graph defines a path from node '0' to node '27'. Each edge represents a direct connection between two consecutive nodes.

The shortest path distance between node '17' and node '7' is simply the difference in their node values (as the graph is linear):

Distance = |17 - 7| = 10.
