To calculate the shortest path between nodes '28' and '24', we can observe that the graph is a simple cycle. The shortest path can be calculated by traversing the graph in either direction and finding the minimum distance.

The graph is represented as a cycle:
```
0 - 1 - 2 - ... - 28 - 0
```

The shortest path between nodes '28' and '24' can be calculated as follows:
1. Traverse clockwise: `28 -> 27 -> 26 -> 25 -> 24` (4 edges).
2. Traverse counterclockwise: `28 -> 0 -> 1 -> ... -> 23 -> 24` (25 edges).

The shortest path is the minimum of these two distances, which is `4`.
