To count the number of edges in the graph, we can sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide by 2 (since each edge is counted twice in an undirected graph). Here's the calculation:

1. Sum of all adjacency list lengths:
   - \( 2 + 2 + 2 + \ldots + 2 = 40 \) (since each node has exactly 2 neighbors in this graph).

2. Divide by 2 to account for double counting:
   - \( 40 / 2 = 20 \).

Thus, the graph has 20 edges.
