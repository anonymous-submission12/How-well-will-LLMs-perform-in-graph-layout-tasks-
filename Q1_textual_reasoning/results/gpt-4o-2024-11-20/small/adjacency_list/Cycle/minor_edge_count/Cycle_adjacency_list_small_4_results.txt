To count the number of edges in the graph, we can sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide by 2 (since each edge is represented twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

- Total connections: \(2 + 2 + 2 + \dots + 2 = 48\) (sum of all adjacency list lengths)
- Number of edges: \(48 / 2 = 24\)
