To count the number of edges in the given graph represented as an adjacency list, we need to note that each edge is listed twice in an undirected graph (once for each of the two nodes it connects). Therefore, we sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide the total by 2 to avoid double-counting.

### Calculation:
Each node has a list of connected nodes. Summing the length of these lists gives the total degree (sum of all degrees in the graph). The total number of edges is half of this total degree.
