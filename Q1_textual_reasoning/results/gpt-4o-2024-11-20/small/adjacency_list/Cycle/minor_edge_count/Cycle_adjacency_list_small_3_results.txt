To count the number of edges in the graph, we can sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide by 2 (since each edge is represented twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

- Total connections: \(2 + 2 + 2 + \ldots + 2 = 44\) (sum of all adjacency list lengths)
- Number of edges: \(44 / 2 = 22\)

Here is the JSON response:
