To count the number of edges in the graph, we can sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide the total by 2 (since each edge is represented twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

1. Sum of lengths of adjacency lists:
   - `len([1, 24]) + len([0, 2]) + len([1, 3]) + ... + len([22, 24]) + len([0, 23])`
   - Each list has 2 elements, and there are 25 nodes, so the total is \( 25 \times 2 = 50 \).

2. Divide by 2 to account for double counting:
   - \( 50 / 2 = 25 \).

Thus, the graph has 25 edges.
