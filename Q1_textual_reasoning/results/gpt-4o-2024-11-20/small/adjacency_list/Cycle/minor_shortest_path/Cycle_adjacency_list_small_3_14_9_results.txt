To calculate the shortest path between node '14' and node '9', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 5
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph is structured as a cycle, and the shortest path between node '14' and node '9' is traversed through the direct connections: `14 -> 13 -> 12 -> 11 -> 10 -> 9`.
- This path consists of 5 edges, so the shortest path length is 5.
