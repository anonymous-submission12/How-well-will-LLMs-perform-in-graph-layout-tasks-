To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we determine the length of the adjacency list for each node. The degree of a node is determined by the number of its neighbors.

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
```

This result indicates that all nodes have a degree of 2, which is the highest degree in the given graph. The graph represents a cycle.
