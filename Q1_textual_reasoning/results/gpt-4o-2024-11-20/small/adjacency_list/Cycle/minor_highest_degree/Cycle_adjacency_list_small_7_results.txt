To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of connections (edges) each node has and find the maximum among them. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph is represented as an adjacency list.
- Each node in the graph has exactly 2 connections (edges), except for the first and last nodes in the adjacency list, which also have 2 connections due to the circular nature of the graph.
- Therefore, the highest degree of any node in the graph is 2.
