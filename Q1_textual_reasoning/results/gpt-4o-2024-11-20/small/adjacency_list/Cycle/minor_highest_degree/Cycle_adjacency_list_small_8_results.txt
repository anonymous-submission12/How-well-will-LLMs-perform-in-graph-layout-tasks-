To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of connections (edges) each node has and find the maximum value.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph is represented as an adjacency list.
- Each node has at most 2 connections (edges), except for node 0 and node 27, which also have 2 connections.
- Therefore, the highest degree of all nodes in the graph is 2.
