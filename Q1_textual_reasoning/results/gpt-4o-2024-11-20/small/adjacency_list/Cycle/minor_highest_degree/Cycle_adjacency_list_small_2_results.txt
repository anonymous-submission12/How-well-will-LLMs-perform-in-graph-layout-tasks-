To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of connections (edges) each node has and find the maximum value.

Here is the calculation:

- Node 0 has connections: [1, 21] → Degree = 2
- Node 1 has connections: [0, 2] → Degree = 2
- Node 2 has connections: [1, 3] → Degree = 2
- Node 3 has connections: [2, 4] → Degree = 2
- Node 4 has connections: [3, 5] → Degree = 2
- Node 5 has connections: [4, 6] → Degree = 2
- Node 6 has connections: [5, 7] → Degree = 2
- Node 7 has connections: [6, 8] → Degree = 2
- Node 8 has connections: [7, 9] → Degree = 2
- Node 9 has connections: [8, 10] → Degree = 2
- Node 10 has connections: [9, 11] → Degree = 2
- Node 11 has connections: [10, 12] → Degree = 2
- Node 12 has connections: [11, 13] → Degree = 2
- Node 13 has connections: [12, 14] → Degree = 2
- Node 14 has connections: [13, 15] → Degree = 2
- Node 15 has connections: [14, 16] → Degree = 2
- Node 16 has connections: [15, 17] → Degree = 2
- Node 17 has connections: [16, 18] → Degree = 2
- Node 18 has connections: [17, 19] → Degree = 2
- Node 19 has connections: [18, 20] → Degree = 2
- Node 20 has connections: [19, 21] → Degree = 2
- Node 21 has connections: [0, 20] → Degree = 2

The highest degree among all nodes is **2**.
