To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, I will determine the number of connections (edges) each node has, and identify the node with the highest degree.

Here is the calculation:

1. Node `0` is connected to `[1, 24]` → Degree: `2`
2. Node `1` is connected to `[0, 2]` → Degree: `2`
3. Node `2` is connected to `[1, 3]` → Degree: `2`
4. Node `3` is connected to `[2, 4]` → Degree: `2`
5. Node `4` is connected to `[3, 5]` → Degree: `2`
6. Node `5` is connected to `[4, 6]` → Degree: `2`
7. Node `6` is connected to `[5, 7]` → Degree: `2`
8. Node `7` is connected to `[6, 8]` → Degree: `2`
9. Node `8` is connected to `[7, 9]` → Degree: `2`
10. Node `9` is connected to `[8, 10]` → Degree: `2`
11. Node `10` is connected to `[9, 11]` → Degree: `2`
12. Node `11` is connected to `[10, 12]` → Degree: `2`
13. Node `12` is connected to `[11, 13]` → Degree: `2`
14. Node `13` is connected to `[12, 14]` → Degree: `2`
15. Node `14` is connected to `[13, 15]` → Degree: `2`
16. Node `15` is connected to `[14, 16]` → Degree: `2`
17. Node `16` is connected to `[15, 17]` → Degree: `2`
18. Node `17` is connected to `[16, 18]` → Degree: `2`
19. Node `18` is connected to `[17, 19]` → Degree: `2`
20. Node `19` is connected to `[18, 20]` → Degree: `2`
21. Node `20` is connected to `[19, 21]` → Degree: `2`
22. Node `21` is connected to `[20, 22]` → Degree: `2`
23. Node `22` is connected to `[21, 23]` → Degree: `2`
24. Node `23` is connected to `[22, 24]` → Degree: `2`
25. Node `24` is connected to `[0, 23]` → Degree: `2`

All nodes in this graph have a degree of `2`. Therefore, the maximum degree is `2`.
