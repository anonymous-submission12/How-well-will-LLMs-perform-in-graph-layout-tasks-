To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a graph traversal algorithm like Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) to identify connected components. Each connected component represents a community.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph has three distinct connected components (or communities):
  1. Nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 14}
  2. Nodes {6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17}
  3. Nodes {16, 18, 19, 20}
