To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as connected components. Based on the adjacency list provided, the graph can be divided into two distinct communities:

1. Nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}.
2. Nodes {14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27}.

Thus, the graph contains **2 communities**.
