To solve the problem, we need to count the connected components in the graph. Each connected component corresponds to a distinct community. Here's how it can be done programmatically:

1. Treat the given adjacency list as an undirected graph.
2. Perform a graph traversal (e.g., BFS or DFS) from each node, marking all reachable nodes.
3. Count the number of times a traversal is initiated (each initiating traversal corresponds to a new community).

The calculation reveals there are `3` distinct communities:

- Nodes `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}` belong to one community (fully connected internally).
- Nodes `{8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}` form another community.
- Nodes `{16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22}` form the third community.

Here is the resulting JSON:
