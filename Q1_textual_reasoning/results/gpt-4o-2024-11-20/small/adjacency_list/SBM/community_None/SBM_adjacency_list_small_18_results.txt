To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or modularity-based clustering. However, for simplicity, we can analyze the graph structure and identify connected components, as each connected component represents a community.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

Explanation:
The graph has three distinct communities based on the adjacency list:
1. Nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.
2. Nodes {10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}.
3. Nodes {20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28}.
