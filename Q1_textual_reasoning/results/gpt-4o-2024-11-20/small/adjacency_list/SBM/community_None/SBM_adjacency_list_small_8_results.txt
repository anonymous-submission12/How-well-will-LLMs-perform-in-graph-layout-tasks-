To compute the number of communities in the graph, we will identify disjoint subgraphs (connected components). Each subgraph represents a community.

The adjacency list you provided is analyzed as follows:

### Graph Analysis:
1. Nodes that are tightly interconnected form subsets (communities).
2. By traversing the graph, we find the number of connected components.

### Result:
The graph has **3 distinct communities**.

Here is the result:
