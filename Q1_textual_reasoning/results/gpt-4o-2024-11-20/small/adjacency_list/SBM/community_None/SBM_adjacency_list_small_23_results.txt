To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to identify connected components. Each connected component represents a community.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph has two distinct communities:
  1. Nodes `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}` form one connected component.
  2. Nodes `{11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}` form another connected component.
