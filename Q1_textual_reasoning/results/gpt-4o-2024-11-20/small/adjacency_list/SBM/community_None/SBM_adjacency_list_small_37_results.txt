To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the connected components approach. Each connected component in the graph represents a community.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph has two distinct communities based on the adjacency list provided:
  - Community 1: Nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}
  - Community 2: Nodes {13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24}
