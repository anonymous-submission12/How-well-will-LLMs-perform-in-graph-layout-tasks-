To count the number of communities in the given graph, we will find the connected components in the graph. Each connected component represents a community.

Using the adjacency list provided, the graph will be parsed and analyzed. Below is the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
``` 

Explanation:
- The graph contains three distinct communities.
  1. Nodes connected to node `0` (community 1).
  2. Nodes connected to node `10` (community 2).
  3. Nodes connected to node `19` (community 3).
