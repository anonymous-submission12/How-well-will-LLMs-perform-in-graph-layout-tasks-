To count the number of communities in the graph, we will determine which nodes are strongly connected as groups of clusters in the adjacency list. From the graph data provided, it is observable that there are two distinct communities:

1. Community 1 includes nodes {0, 1, 2, ..., 13}.
2. Community 2 includes nodes {14, 15, ..., 26}.

Thus, there are 2 communities. Here is the JSON output:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
