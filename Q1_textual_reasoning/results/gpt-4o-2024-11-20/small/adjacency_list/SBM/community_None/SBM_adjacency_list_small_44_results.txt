To count the number of communities in the graph, we can identify connected components using the adjacency list. Each connected component represents a distinct community.

Hereâ€™s the solution:

1. Traverse the graph using a technique like DFS or BFS.
2. Identify all distinct connected components.

The number of connected components is the number of communities. After processing the given adjacency list, we find the following:

**Answer:** 3 communities.

Here is the JSON output:
