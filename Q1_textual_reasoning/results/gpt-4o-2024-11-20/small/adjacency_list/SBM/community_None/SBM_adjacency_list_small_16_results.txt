To determine the number of communities in the graph, we need to identify connected components in the graph data provided in adjacency list format. Let's count the communities:

### Step-by-step Process:
1. Each community corresponds to a connected component in the graph.
2. We can implement a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to explore and count the connected components.

Here is the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

### Explanation:
The graph consists of **4 connected components**:
1. Nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
2. Nodes {7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}.
3. Nodes {14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}.
4. Nodes {20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25}.
