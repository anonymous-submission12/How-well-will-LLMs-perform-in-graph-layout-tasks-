To determine the number of communities in the graph, we need to identify connected components (sub-graphs where any two vertices are connected, and no vertex is connected to vertices outside the sub-graph). Here's the calculation:

The adjacency list describes the graph, and we can traverse it to find all connected components. Using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), we can explore nodes and separate them into distinct communities.

After examining the provided adjacency list, the graph is divided into **3 connected components (or communities):**

1. Nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 13, 14, 19, 18}.
2. Nodes {7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}.
3. Nodes {14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}.

Each set represents a community. The total count of communities is **3**.
