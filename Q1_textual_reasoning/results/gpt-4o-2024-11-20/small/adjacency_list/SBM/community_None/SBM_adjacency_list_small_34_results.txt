To count the number of communities in the graph, we can use a graph traversal algorithm like Depth First Search (DFS) to identify connected components. Each connected component represents a community.

Here is the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph has 4 distinct communities:
  1. Nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
  2. Nodes {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
  3. Nodes {11, 12, 13, 14, 15}
  4. Nodes {16, 17, 18, 19, 20}
