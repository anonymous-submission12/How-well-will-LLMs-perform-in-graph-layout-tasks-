To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) to identify connected components. Each connected component represents a community.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph has two distinct connected components:
  1. Nodes `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}` form one community.
  2. Nodes `{12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22}` form another community.
