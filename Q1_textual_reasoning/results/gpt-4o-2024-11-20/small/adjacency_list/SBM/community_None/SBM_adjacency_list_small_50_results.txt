To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a graph traversal algorithm like Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) to identify connected components. Each connected component represents a community.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

### Explanation:
The graph has 4 connected components (communities):
1. Nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
2. Nodes {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
3. Nodes {11, 12, 13, 14, 15}
4. Nodes {16, 17, 18, 19, 20}
