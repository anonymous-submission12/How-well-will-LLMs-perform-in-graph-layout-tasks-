To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to identify connected components. Each connected component represents a community.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph has 4 connected components (communities):
  1. Nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
  2. Nodes {6, 7, 8, 10, 11}
  3. Nodes {12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17}
  4. Nodes {18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27}
