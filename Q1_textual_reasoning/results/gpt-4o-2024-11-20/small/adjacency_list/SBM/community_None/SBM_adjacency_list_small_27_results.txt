To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can identify connected components, where each connected component represents a distinct community.

Let's calculate the number of communities based on the adjacency list provided:

```json
{
  "answer": 5
}
```

### Explanation:
The graph contains 5 distinct communities based on the provided adjacency list:
1. Nodes connected to {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 16, 27}.
2. Nodes connected to {6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}.
3. Nodes connected to {12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17}.
4. Nodes connected to {18, 19, 20, 21, 22}.
5. Nodes connected to {23, 24, 25, 26, 27}.

Each community is effectively a connected component in the graph structure.
