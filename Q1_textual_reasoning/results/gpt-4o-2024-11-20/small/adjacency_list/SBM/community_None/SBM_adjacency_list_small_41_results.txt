To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to identify connected components. Each connected component represents a community.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

Explanation:
The graph has 4 distinct communities based on the adjacency list:
1. Community 1: Nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
2. Community 2: Nodes {6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}
3. Community 3: Nodes {12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17}
4. Community 4: Nodes {18, 19, 20, 21, 22}
