To count the number of communities in the graph, we can use a method such as determining connected components. Each connected component represents a community. Below is the result of analyzing the given adjacency list:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

Explanation:  
The graph divides into three distinct communities based on its structure:
1. Community 1: Nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.
2. Community 2: Nodes {9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17}.
3. Community 3: Nodes {18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25}.
