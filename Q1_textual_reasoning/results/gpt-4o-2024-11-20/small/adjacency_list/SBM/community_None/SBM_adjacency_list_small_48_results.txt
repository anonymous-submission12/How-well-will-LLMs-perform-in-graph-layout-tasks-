To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the connected components approach. Each connected component in the graph represents a community.

Here is the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
``` 

Explanation:
- The graph has two distinct communities:
  - Nodes `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}` form one connected component.
  - Nodes `{13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25}` form another connected component.
