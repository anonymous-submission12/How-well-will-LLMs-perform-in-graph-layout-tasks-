To determine the number of communities in the provided graph, we need to identify connected components. Each connected component represents a community in the graph.

Here is the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 5
}
```

Explanation:
The graph contains the following connected components:
1. Nodes `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}` form one community.
2. Nodes `{5, 6, 7, 8, 9}` form another community.
3. Nodes `{10, 11, 12, 13, 14}` form a third community.
4. Nodes `{15, 16, 17, 18, 19}` form a fourth community.
5. Nodes `{20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}` form the fifth community.

Thus, the graph has 5 distinct communities.
