To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to identify connected components. Each connected component represents a community.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph has three distinct communities based on the adjacency list:
  1. Nodes `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}` form one community.
  2. Nodes `{8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}` form another community.
  3. Nodes `{16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23}` form the third community.
