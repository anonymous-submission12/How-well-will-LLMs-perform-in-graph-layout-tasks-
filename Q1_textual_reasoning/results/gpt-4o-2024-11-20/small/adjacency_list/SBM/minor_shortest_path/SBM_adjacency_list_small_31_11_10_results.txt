To calculate the shortest path between node '11' and node '10', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```

Explanation:
- From the adjacency list, we can see that node '11' is directly connected to node '10'. Therefore, the shortest path length between them is 1.
