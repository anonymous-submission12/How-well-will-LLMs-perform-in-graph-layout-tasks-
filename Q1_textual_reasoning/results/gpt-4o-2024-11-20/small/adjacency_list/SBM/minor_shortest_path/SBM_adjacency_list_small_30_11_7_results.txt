To calculate the shortest path between node '11' and node '7' using the adjacency list graph provided, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS ensures that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges between the two nodes.

Here is the computation result:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```

Explanation:
- Node '11' is directly connected to node '7' as per the adjacency list. Hence, the shortest path length between them is `1`.
