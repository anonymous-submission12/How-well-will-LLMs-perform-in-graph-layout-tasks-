To calculate the shortest path between nodes '24' and '9', we will use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is effective for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

Explanation: 
By traversing the graph using BFS, the shortest path from node '24' to node '9' is:
24 → 11 → 10 → 9 (with a length of 4 edges).
