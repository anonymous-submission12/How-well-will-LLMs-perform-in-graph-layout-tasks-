To calculate the shortest path between nodes '20' and '23', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```

Explanation:
From the adjacency list, node '20' is directly connected to node '23'. Therefore, the shortest path length between them is 1.
