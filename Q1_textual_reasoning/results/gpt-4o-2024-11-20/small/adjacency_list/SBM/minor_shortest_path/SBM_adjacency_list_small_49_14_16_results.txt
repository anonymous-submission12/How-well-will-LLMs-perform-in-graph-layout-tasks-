To calculate the shortest path between nodes '14' and '16', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```

### Explanation:
- From the adjacency list, node '14' is directly connected to node '16'.
- Therefore, the shortest path length between '14' and '16' is 1.
