To calculate the shortest path between node '4' and node '2', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```

### Explanation:
In the given adjacency list, node '4' is directly connected to node '2'. Therefore, the shortest path length between node '4' and node '2' is **1**.
