To calculate the shortest path between nodes "19" and "22" in the given graph, I will use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm since it is efficient for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, such as the adjacency list provided.

The shortest path length between "19" and "22" is as follows:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```
