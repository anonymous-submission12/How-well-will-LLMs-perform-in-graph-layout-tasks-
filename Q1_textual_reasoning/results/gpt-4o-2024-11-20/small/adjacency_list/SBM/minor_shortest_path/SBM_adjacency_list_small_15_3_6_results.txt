To calculate the shortest path between node '3' and node '6', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```

Explanation:
- From the adjacency list, node '3' is directly connected to node '6'. Therefore, the shortest path length between node '3' and node '6' is 1.
