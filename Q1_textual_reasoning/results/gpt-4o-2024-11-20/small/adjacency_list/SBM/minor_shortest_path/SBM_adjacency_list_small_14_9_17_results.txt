To find the shortest path between nodes '9' and '17', we can use the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm since it's highly suitable for unweighted graphs like the one in adjacency list format provided.

Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 6
}
```

Let me know if you'd like to see the step-by-step details of how BFS was applied.
