To determine the length of the shortest path between nodes '11' and '5', we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) because the graph is unweighted. Here is the calculated result:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```

Explanation:
- Node '11' is directly connected to node '5' as shown in the adjacency list: `11: [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9]`.
- Therefore, the shortest path between '11' and '5' has a length of 1.
