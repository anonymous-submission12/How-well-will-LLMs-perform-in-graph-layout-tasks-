To calculate the shortest path between node '2' and node '1', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```

### Explanation:
- From the adjacency list, node '2' is directly connected to node '1'. Therefore, the shortest path length between node '2' and node '1' is `1`.
