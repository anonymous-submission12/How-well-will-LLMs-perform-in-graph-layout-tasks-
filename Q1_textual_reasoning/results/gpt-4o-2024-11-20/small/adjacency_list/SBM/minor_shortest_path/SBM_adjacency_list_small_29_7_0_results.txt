To calculate the shortest path between node '7' and node '0', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
```

### Explanation:
1. Start BFS from node '7'.
2. Explore its neighbors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
3. In the next level, explore the neighbors of these nodes. Node '0' is reached via node '3' or node '4' in 2 steps.
4. Therefore, the shortest path length between node '7' and node '0' is 2.
