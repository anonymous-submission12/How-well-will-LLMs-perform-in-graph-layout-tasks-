To calculate the shortest path between nodes '17' and '21', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
``` 

Explanation:
- Starting from node '17', we can directly reach node '21' in 2 steps:
  - Step 1: From '17' to '21' via their direct connection.
