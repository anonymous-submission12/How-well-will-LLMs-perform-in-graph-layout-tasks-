To calculate the length of the shortest path between nodes `15` and `0`, we can use BFS (Breadth-First Search) since it is suitable for unweighted graphs. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
```

### Explanation:
1. The BFS starts at node `15` and explores the graph level by level.
2. Node `15` has a direct edge to node `12`.
3. Node `12` has a direct edge to node `0`.

Thus, the shortest path from node `15` to `0` is through `15 → 12 → 0`, with a length of `2`.
