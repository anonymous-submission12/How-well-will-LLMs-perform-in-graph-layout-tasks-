To calculate the shortest path between nodes '18' and '20', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```

Explanation: In the given graph, node '18' is directly connected to node '20', so the shortest path length is 1.
