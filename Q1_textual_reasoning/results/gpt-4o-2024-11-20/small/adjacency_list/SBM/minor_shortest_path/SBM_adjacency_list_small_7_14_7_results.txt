To calculate the shortest path between nodes '14' and '7', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, as it is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

### Steps:
1. Represent the graph using the adjacency list.
2. Perform BFS starting from node '14' to find the shortest path to node '7'.

### BFS Implementation:
Here is the solution and the shortest path:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

Explanation:
The shortest path from node '14' to node '7' is: `14 -> 15 -> 12 -> 7`. This path has a length of 3.
