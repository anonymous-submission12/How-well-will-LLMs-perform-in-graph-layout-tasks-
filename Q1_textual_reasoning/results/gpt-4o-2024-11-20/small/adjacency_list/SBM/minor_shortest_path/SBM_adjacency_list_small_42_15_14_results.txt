To calculate the shortest path between nodes '15' and '14', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```

Explanation:
In the adjacency list provided, node '15' is directly connected to node '14'. Therefore, the shortest path length between them is 1.
