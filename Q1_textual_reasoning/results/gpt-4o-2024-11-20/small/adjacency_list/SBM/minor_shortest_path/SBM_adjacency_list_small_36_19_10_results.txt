To calculate the shortest path between node `19` and node `10`, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) method on the graph represented by the adjacency list. BFS is appropriate because it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the BFS implementation and the computed result:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
``` 

Explanation:
1. Starting from node `19`, the BFS expands level by level.
2. The shortest path found between `19` and `10` is through the sequence: `19 -> 0 -> 3 -> 9 -> 10`, which has a total path length of `4`.
