To solve this, I will calculate the shortest path from node '15' to node '0' using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like the one provided.

Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
``` 

Explanation:
1. Start BFS from node '15'.
2. Exploring the connections from node '15', we can reach its neighbors ('16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '25') in 1 step.
3. From these neighbors, we continue the BFS process until reaching node '0'. Specifically:
   - From '15' -> '18' -> '8' -> '2' -> '0'.
