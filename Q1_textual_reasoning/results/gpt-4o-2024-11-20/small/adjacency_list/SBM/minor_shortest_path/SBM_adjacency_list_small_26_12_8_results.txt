To calculate the shortest path between node '12' and '8', we can use the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS ensures we find the shortest path in an unweighted graph like the one given.

### Calculation:
1. Start from node '12'.
2. Explore all neighboring nodes level by level until reaching node '8'.

The shortest path from node '12' to '8' is directly 1 step, because the two nodes are immediate neighbors in the graph.
