To calculate the shortest path between node '7' and node '2', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": -1
}
```

Explanation:
The graph is disconnected, meaning there is no path between node '7' and node '2'. Therefore, the shortest path length is represented as `-1`.
