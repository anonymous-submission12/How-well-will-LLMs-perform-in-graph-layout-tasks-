To determine the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of neighbors for each node in the adjacency list and find the maximum value.

Below is the result showing the highest degree of all nodes:

```json
{
  "answer": 6
}
```

Explanation:  
- The degree of a node is determined by counting the length of its adjacency list.
- After iterating through all nodes in the given adjacency list, the highest degree value we found is **6**, which occurs for several nodes (e.g., node 8 and node 9 among others).
