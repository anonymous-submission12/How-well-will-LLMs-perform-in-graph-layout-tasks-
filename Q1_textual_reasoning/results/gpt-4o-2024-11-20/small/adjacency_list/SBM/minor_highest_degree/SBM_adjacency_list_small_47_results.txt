To calculate the highest degree of all the nodes in the graph, we determine the degree of each node by counting the number of connections (edges). The degree of a node corresponds to the size of its adjacency list. After calculating the degrees for all nodes in the graph, we find the maximum degree.

### Steps:
1. Calculate the degree for each node.
2. Find the maximum degree.

Here is the JSON representation of the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 7
}
```

### Explanation:
- Node 5 has the highest degree of 7, as it is connected to 7 other nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7].
