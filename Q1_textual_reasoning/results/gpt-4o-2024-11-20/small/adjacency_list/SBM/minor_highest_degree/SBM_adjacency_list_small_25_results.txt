To determine the highest degree of all nodes in the graph represented by the adjacency list, we calculate the degree of each node (the number of neighbors) and find the maximum value.

Below is the JSON result with the highest degree:

```json
{
  "answer": 8
}
```

This is because node `11` has the highest degree of 8, with connections to nodes `[5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 18]`.
