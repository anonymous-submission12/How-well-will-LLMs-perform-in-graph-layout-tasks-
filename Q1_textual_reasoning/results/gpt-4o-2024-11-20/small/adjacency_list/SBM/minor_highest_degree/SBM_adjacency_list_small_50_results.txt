To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of connections (or edges) each node has and find the maximum degree. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 5
}
```

This result is the maximum degree observed among all the nodes in the graph adjacency list.
