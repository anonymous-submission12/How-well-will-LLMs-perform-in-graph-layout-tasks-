To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of neighbors (degree) for each node and find the maximum degree.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 8
}
```

Explanation:
- The degree of a node is the number of connections (edges) it has.
- After analyzing the adjacency list, the node with the highest degree is node `4` and node `12`, both having a degree of `8`.
