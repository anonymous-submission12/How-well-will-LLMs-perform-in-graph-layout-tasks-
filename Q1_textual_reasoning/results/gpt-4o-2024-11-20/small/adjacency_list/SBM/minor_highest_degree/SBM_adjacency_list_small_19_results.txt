To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we determine the number of neighbors for each node and find the maximum value. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 7
}
```

Explanation: The highest degree across all nodes is **7** because multiple nodes (e.g., `0`, `1`, `7`, `14`, etc.) have 7 neighbors.
