To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we count the number of connections (edges) each node has. The degree of a node is simply the size of its adjacency list. Let's compute this.

```json
{
  "answer": 7
}
```

The highest degree observed in this graph is **7**, which corresponds to nodes `3`, `7`, and `21`.
