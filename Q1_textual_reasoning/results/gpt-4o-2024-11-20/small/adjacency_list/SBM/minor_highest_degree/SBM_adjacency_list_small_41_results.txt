To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the degree of each node by counting the number of neighbors for each node in the adjacency list. The degree is the size of the list of neighbors for each node.

Here is the computed result:

```json
{
  "answer": 5
}
```

Explanation:
- The node with the highest degree is one of several nodes that have 5 neighbors. Examples include node 1, node 2, node 8, and several others. The "highest degree" is therefore 5.
