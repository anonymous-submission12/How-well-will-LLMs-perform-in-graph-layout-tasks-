To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, the degree of a node is the number of neighbors it has, represented by the length of its corresponding adjacency list. Hereâ€™s the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 11
}
```

The highest degree in the given graph is **11**, which belongs to node **3**.
