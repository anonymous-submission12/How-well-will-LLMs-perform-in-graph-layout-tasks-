To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of connections each node has. The degree of a node can be found by counting the elements of its adjacency list. Then, we'll find the maximum degree among all nodes.

Let's compute this:

```json
{
  "answer": 9
}
```

Explanation:  
From the adjacency list provided, the node with the highest degree is node `9` (among several others), which has `9` connections. This is the maximum degree in the graph.
