To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of connections (edges) each node has and find the maximum value among them.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 11
}
```

Explanation:
- The degree of a node is the number of connections it has.
- After analyzing the adjacency list, the node with the highest degree is node `9`, which has `11` connections.
