To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we determine the number of connections (edges) each node has by calculating the length of its adjacency list and find the maximum.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 12
}
```

Explanation:
- The node `14` has the highest degree with `12` connections, making `12` the highest degree of all nodes in the graph.
