To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we find the maximum length of the adjacency list for any node in the given graph.

### Steps:
1. Iterate through each node and its adjacency list.
2. Compute the degree for each node as the length of its adjacency list.
3. Find the maximum degree among all nodes.

Performing this computation, the maximum degree of any node is **7** (node 3 has the highest degree with 7 connections).
