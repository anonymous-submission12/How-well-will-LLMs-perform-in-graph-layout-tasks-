To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of connections (edges) each node has and find the maximum among them. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 11
}
```

Explanation:
- The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it, which corresponds to the length of its adjacency list.
- After analyzing the adjacency list provided, the node with the highest degree is node `16`, which has 11 connections.
