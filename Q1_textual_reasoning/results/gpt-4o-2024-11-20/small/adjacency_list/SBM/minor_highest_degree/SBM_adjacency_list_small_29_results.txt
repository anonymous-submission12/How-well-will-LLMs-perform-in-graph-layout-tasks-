To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we simply find the node with the largest number of neighbors. The degree of a node is equal to the length of its adjacency list. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 8
}
```

Explanation:  
Among all the nodes, node `4` has the highest degree, with 8 neighbors (`[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 17]`). Hence, the answer is `8`.
