To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of connections (edges) each node has and find the maximum value among them.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 5
}
```

Explanation:
- The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.
- From the adjacency list provided, the degrees of the nodes are:
  - Node 0: 3
  - Node 1: 5
  - Node 2: 3
  - Node 3: 5
  - Node 4: 2
  - Node 5: 3
  - Node 6: 3
  - Node 7: 3
  - Node 8: 4
  - Node 9: 3
  - Node 10: 4
  - Node 11: 3
  - Node 12: 3
  - Node 13: 3
  - Node 14: 4
  - Node 15: 3
  - Node 16: 4
  - Node 17: 5
  - Node 18: 4
  - Node 19: 4
  - Node 20: 5
- The highest degree is 5, which is shared by nodes 1, 3, 17, and 20.
