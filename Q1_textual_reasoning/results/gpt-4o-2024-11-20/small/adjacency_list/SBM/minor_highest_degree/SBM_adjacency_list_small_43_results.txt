To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the given graph, we need to determine the number of connections (edges) each node has and find the maximum.

Hereâ€™s the solution using the provided adjacency list:

- Degree of a node is the length of its corresponding list in the adjacency list.
- We calculate the degree for each node and then find the maximum degree.

The result is as follows:
