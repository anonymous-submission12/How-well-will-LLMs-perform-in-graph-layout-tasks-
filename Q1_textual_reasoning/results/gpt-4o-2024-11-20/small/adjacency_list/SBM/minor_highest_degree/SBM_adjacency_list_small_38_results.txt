To determine the highest degree of all nodes in the given graph, we calculate the degree of each node as the number of connections it has. The degree of a node in the adjacency list is the length of the list of its neighbors. Below is the JSON response:

```json
{
  "answer": 6
}
``` 

Explanation: The node with the highest degree is either Node 6, Node 26, or Node 28, each of which has a degree of 6.
