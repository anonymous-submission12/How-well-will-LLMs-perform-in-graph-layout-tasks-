To determine the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we calculate the degree of each node by counting the number of connections (edges) it has. Using the adjacency list provided:

```json
{
  "answer": 8
}
```

The highest degree in the graph is 8, corresponding to node `18`, which has connections to `3, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20`.
