To determine the highest degree of all nodes in the given graph, we calculate the degree (number of edges) of each node by counting the elements in its adjacency list. The highest degree is the maximum of these values.

Let's calculate:

```json
{
  "answer": 13
}
```

Explanation:
- Node 24 has the highest degree with 13 connections.
