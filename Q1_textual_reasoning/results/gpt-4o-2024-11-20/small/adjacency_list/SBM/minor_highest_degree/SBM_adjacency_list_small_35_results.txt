To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of neighbors (degree) for each node and find the maximum degree.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 8
}
```

Explanation:
- The degree of a node is the number of neighbors it has in the adjacency list.
- After calculating the degree for each node, the maximum degree is found to be 8, which occurs for nodes 1, 3, and 20.
