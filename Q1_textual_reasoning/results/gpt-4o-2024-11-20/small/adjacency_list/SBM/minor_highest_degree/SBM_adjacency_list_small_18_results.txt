To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of connections (edges) for each node and then find the maximum value among these degrees. Here's the calculation:

```json
{
  "answer": 10
}
```

Explanation:
- Degree of a node is the length of its adjacency list.
- After calculating the degrees for all nodes in the provided adjacency list, the highest degree is **10**, which corresponds to several nodes such as node 23 and 13.
