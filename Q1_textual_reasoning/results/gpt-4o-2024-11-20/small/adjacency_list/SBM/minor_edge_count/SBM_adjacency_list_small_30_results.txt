To find the number of edges in the graph represented by the given adjacency list, we can follow these steps:

1. Count the number of neighbors for each node in the adjacency list.
2. The sum of all counts across all nodes will give us twice the number of edges since each edge is counted twice (once for each endpoint).
3. Divide the sum of neighbors by 2 to get the total number of unique edges.

Here is the calculation:
