To count the number of edges in the graph, we can sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide the total by 2 (since each edge is represented twice in an undirected graph). Here's the calculation:

1. Sum of all adjacency list lengths:
   - `len([1, 2, 4, 5]) = 4`
   - `len([0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11]) = 6`
   - `len([0, 1, 3, 4, 5]) = 5`
   - `len([1, 2, 4, 10, 17]) = 5`
   - `len([0, 1, 2, 3, 5]) = 5`
   - `len([0, 1, 2, 4]) = 4`
   - `len([7, 8, 10, 11]) = 4`
   - `len([6, 11]) = 2`
   - `len([6, 9, 10]) = 3`
   - `len([8, 10, 11]) = 3`
   - `len([3, 6, 8, 9, 14]) = 5`
   - `len([1, 6, 7, 9, 15]) = 5`
   - `len([13, 15, 16]) = 3`
   - `len([12, 14, 15, 16]) = 4`
   - `len([10, 13, 15, 16]) = 4`
   - `len([11, 12, 13, 14, 16]) = 5`
   - `len([12, 13, 14, 15]) = 4`
   - `len([3, 18, 19, 20, 21]) = 5`
   - `len([17, 19, 20]) = 3`
   - `len([17, 18]) = 2`
   - `len([17, 18, 21]) = 3`
   - `len([17, 20]) = 2`

   Total = 4 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 87

2. Divide by 2 to account for double counting:
   - `87 / 2 = 43.5`

Since the number of edges must be an integer, the graph has **43 edges**.
