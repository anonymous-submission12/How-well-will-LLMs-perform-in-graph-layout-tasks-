To count the number of edges in the graph, we need to sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide the total by 2 (since each edge is represented twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists:
   - `0: [1, 2, 3]` → 3 edges
   - `1: [0, 3, 4, 5]` → 4 edges
   - `2: [0, 3, 4, 5]` → 4 edges
   - `3: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5]` → 5 edges
   - `4: [1, 2, 3, 5, 22]` → 5 edges
   - `5: [1, 2, 3, 4, 14]` → 5 edges
   - `6: [7, 8, 10]` → 3 edges
   - `7: [6, 8, 9, 10, 11]` → 5 edges
   - `8: [6, 7, 9, 10, 11]` → 5 edges
   - `9: [7, 8, 10, 11]` → 4 edges
   - `10: [6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 26]` → 6 edges
   - `11: [7, 8, 9, 10]` → 4 edges
   - `12: [13, 16, 17]` → 3 edges
   - `13: [12, 15, 16, 17, 25]` → 5 edges
   - `14: [5, 15, 16, 17, 19]` → 5 edges
   - `15: [13, 14, 16, 17]` → 4 edges
   - `16: [12, 13, 14, 15, 17]` → 5 edges
   - `17: [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]` → 5 edges
   - `18: [19, 20, 21, 22]` → 4 edges
   - `19: [14, 18, 20, 21]` → 4 edges
   - `20: [18, 19, 21, 22]` → 4 edges
   - `21: [18, 19, 20, 22]` → 4 edges
   - `22: [4, 18, 20, 21]` → 4 edges
   - `23: [24, 25, 26, 27]` → 4 edges
   - `24: [23, 26, 27]` → 3 edges
   - `25: [13, 23, 26, 27]` → 4 edges
   - `26: [10, 23, 24, 25, 27]` → 5 edges
   - `27: [23, 24, 25, 26]` → 4 edges

   Total sum = 112.

2. Divide the total by 2 to account for double counting:
   - `112 / 2 = 56`.

Thus, the graph has **56 edges**.
