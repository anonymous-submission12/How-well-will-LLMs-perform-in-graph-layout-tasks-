To solve the problem of counting the edges in the graph represented by the given adjacency list, we proceed as follows:

1. Sum up the lengths of all adjacency lists (each list contains the neighbors of a node).
2. Since the graph is undirected, each edge is counted twice in the adjacency list representation. Therefore, divide the total by 2 to get the final number of edges.

Here's the calculation and result wrapped in a JSON code block:
