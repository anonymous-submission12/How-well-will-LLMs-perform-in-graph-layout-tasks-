To count the number of edges in the graph represented by the adjacency list, we sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide the total by 2 (since each edge is counted twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists:
   - Node 0: 8 edges
   - Node 1: 7 edges
   - Node 2: 8 edges
   - Node 3: 11 edges
   - Node 4: 8 edges
   - Node 5: 7 edges
   - Node 6: 8 edges
   - Node 7: 8 edges
   - Node 8: 6 edges
   - Node 9: 9 edges
   - Node 10: 7 edges
   - Node 11: 7 edges
   - Node 12: 7 edges
   - Node 13: 7 edges
   - Node 14: 9 edges
   - Node 15: 6 edges
   - Node 16: 7 edges
   - Node 17: 7 edges
   - Node 18: 9 edges
   - Node 19: 9 edges
   - Node 20: 9 edges

   Total = 139 edges.

2. Divide by 2 to account for double counting:
   \( \text{Number of edges} = \frac{139}{2} = 69.5 \)

Since the number of edges must be an integer, we round down to 69 edges.
