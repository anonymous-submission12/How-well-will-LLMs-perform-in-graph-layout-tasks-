To calculate the total number of edges in the graph represented as an adjacency list, we need to traverse through the graph, count all connections, and divide the total count by 2 (because each edge is listed twice: once for each vertex it connects).

### Steps:
1. Traverse through each key-value pair in the adjacency list.
2. Count the length of the list (i.e., the edges listed for each vertex).
3. Sum these lengths across all vertices and divide the sum by 2.

### Calculation:

1. Summing lengths of adjacency lists:
   ```plaintext
   Vertex sizes: 
   7 (0), 8 (1), 8 (2), 6 (3), 7 (4), 7 (5), 7 (6), 7 (7), 5 (8), 9 (9), 
   7 (10), 8 (11), 7 (12), 6 (13), 6 (14), 5 (15), 
   7 (16), 4 (17), 6 (18), 
   8 (19), 7 (20), 7 (21), 7 (22), 6 (23), 9 (24), 
   8 (25), 6 (26), 5 (27)
   Sum = 206
   ```

2. Divide by 2 (to account for duplicate edge counting):
   ```plaintext
   Total edges = 206 / 2 = 103
   ```

### JSON Output:
```json
{
  "answer": 103
}
