To count the number of edges in the graph from the given adjacency list, note three points:
1. Each edge is represented twice in the adjacency list (once for each of its two vertices).
2. We count all the connections from the adjacency list.
3. We then divide the total connections by 2 to get the actual number of edges.

**Let's solve this step by step:**

### Calculation
1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists for each vertex:
   - Vertex 0: [1, 4, 5, 8] → 4
   - Vertex 1: [0, 2, 5, 6, 24] → 5
   - Vertex 2: [1, 3, 5, 6] → 4
   - Vertex 3: [2, 4, 9] → 3
   - Vertex 4: [0, 3, 6] → 3
   - Vertex 5: [0, 1, 2, 6] → 4
   - Vertex 6: [1, 2, 4, 5] → 4
   - Vertex 7: [8, 9, 11, 12, 13] → 5
   - Vertex 8: [0, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14] → 6
   - Vertex 9: [3, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12] → 6
   - Vertex 10: [8, 9, 11, 12] → 4
   - Vertex 11: [7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 20] → 6
   - Vertex 12: [7, 9, 10, 11] → 4
   - Vertex 13: [7, 8, 11] → 3
   - Vertex 14: [8, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20] → 6
   - Vertex 15: [14, 18, 19, 20] → 4
   - Vertex 16: [14, 17, 19, 20] → 4
   - Vertex 17: [14, 16, 18, 19] → 4
   - Vertex 18: [15, 17, 20] → 3
   - Vertex 19: [14, 15, 16, 17] → 4
   - Vertex 20: [11, 14, 15, 16, 18] → 5
   - Vertex 21: [22, 23, 24, 26, 27] → 5
   - Vertex 22: [21, 25, 26, 27] → 4
   - Vertex 23: [21, 24, 25, 26, 27] → 5
   - Vertex 24: [1, 21, 23, 25, 26, 27] → 6
   - Vertex 25: [22, 23, 24, 27] → 4
   - Vertex 26: [21, 22, 23, 24, 27] → 5
   - Vertex 27: [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] → 6

   Total connections = **110**

2. Divide the total connections by 2 to get the number of edges:
   Number of edges = 110 / 2 = **55**
