To count the number of edges in the graph represented by the adjacency list, we note that every edge is listed twice (once for each of its endpoints). Therefore, we need to count the total number of connections and divide the sum by 2.

Here is the calculation:

- Sum up all the sizes of the adjacency lists for each node.
- Divide the total by 2 to avoid double-counting edges.

### Calculation:

Sizes of adjacency lists:
- 0: 4
- 1: 5
- 2: 4
- 3: 3
- 4: 8
- 5: 5
- 6: 6
- 7: 5
- 8: 7
- 9: 6
- 10: 6
- 11: 6
- 12: 7
- 13: 6
- 14: 4
- 15: 6
- 16: 5
- 17: 7
- 18: 5
- 19: 6
- 20: 6
- 21: 4
- 22: 5
- 23: 4
- 24: 4
- 25: 5
- 26: 5

Total sum of edges is:
4 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 8 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 7 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 6 + 4 + 6 + 5 + 7 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 139.

Dividing by 2 (since each edge is counted twice):
139 / 2 = 69.5 â†’ Rounded down: 69 edges.
```
