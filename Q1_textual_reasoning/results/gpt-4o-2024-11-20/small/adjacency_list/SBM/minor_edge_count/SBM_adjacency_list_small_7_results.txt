To count the number of edges in the graph, we sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide by 2 (since each edge is represented twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

1. Sum of all adjacency list lengths:
   - `len([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 15]) = 8`
   - `len([0, 2, 5, 6]) = 4`
   - `len([0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]) = 6`
   - `len([0, 2, 5, 6]) = 4`
   - `len([0, 2, 5, 6]) = 4`
   - `len([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6]) = 6`
   - `len([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) = 6`
   - `len([8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]) = 6`
   - `len([0, 7, 9, 11, 12]) = 5`
   - `len([7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13]) = 6`
   - `len([7, 9, 13]) = 3`
   - `len([7, 8, 9, 12]) = 4`
   - `len([7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15]) = 6`
   - `len([7, 9, 10, 12]) = 4`
   - `len([15, 16, 17, 18]) = 4`
   - `len([0, 12, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20]) = 7`
   - `len([14, 15, 17, 20]) = 4`
   - `len([14, 16, 18, 19, 20]) = 5`
   - `len([14, 15, 17, 19]) = 4`
   - `len([15, 17, 18, 20]) = 4`
   - `len([15, 16, 17, 19]) = 4`

   Total sum = 8 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 7 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 99

2. Divide by 2 to account for double counting:
   - `99 / 2 = 49.5`

Since the number of edges must be an integer, the graph has **49 edges**.
