To count the number of edges in the graph, we can sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide by 2 (since each edge is counted twice in an undirected graph). Here's the calculation:

1. Sum of all adjacency list lengths:
   - Node 0: 4
   - Node 1: 5
   - Node 2: 5
   - Node 3: 5
   - Node 4: 3
   - Node 5: 5
   - Node 6: 2
   - Node 7: 2
   - Node 8: 3
   - Node 9: 2
   - Node 10: 5
   - Node 11: 2
   - Node 12: 4
   - Node 13: 2
   - Node 14: 4
   - Node 15: 2
   - Node 16: 5
   - Node 17: 2
   - Node 18: 4
   - Node 19: 3
   - Node 20: 5

   Total = 78

2. Divide by 2 to account for double-counting:
   - Total edges = 78 / 2 = 39

Here is the JSON response:
