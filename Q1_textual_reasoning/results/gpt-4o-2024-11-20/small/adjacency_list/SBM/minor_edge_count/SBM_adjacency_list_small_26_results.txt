To count the number of edges in the graph given in adjacency list format, we can sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and then divide by 2 (since each edge is counted twice in an undirected graph).

Here's the calculation process:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists.
2. Divide this total by 2 to account for double-counting.

For the provided graph, here is the JSON output with the number of edges:

```json
{
  "answer": 78
}
