To count the number of edges in the graph represented as an adjacency list, we sum the lengths of the lists for all vertices and divide the total by 2 (since each edge is counted twice in an undirected graph). 

Here is the calculation:

1. Sum up the lengths of all adjacency lists.
2. Divide the sum by 2 to get the actual number of edges.
