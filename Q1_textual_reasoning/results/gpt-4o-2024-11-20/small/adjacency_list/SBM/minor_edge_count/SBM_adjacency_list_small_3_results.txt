To find the number of edges in the given graph, we need to count all the connections represented in the adjacency list, taking care not to double-count any edges. Since the adjacency list specifies each edge twice (once for each vertex), we divide the total count by 2.

Given the graph, here's the calculation and the resulting count:

{
  "answer": 93
}
