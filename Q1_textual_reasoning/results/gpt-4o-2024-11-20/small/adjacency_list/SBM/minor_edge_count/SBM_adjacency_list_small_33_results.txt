To count the number of edges in the graph represented by the adjacency list, we need to sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide the total by 2 (since each edge is counted twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists:
   - `0: [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` → 8 edges
   - `1: [5, 6, 8, 9, 10]` → 5 edges
   - `2: [0, 3, 6]` → 3 edges
   - `3: [0, 2, 4, 7, 9]` → 5 edges
   - `4: [0, 3, 5, 7, 14, 19]` → 6 edges
   - `5: [1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10]` → 6 edges
   - `6: [0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]` → 8 edges
   - `7: [0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]` → 6 edges
   - `8: [0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 10]` → 6 edges
   - `9: [0, 1, 3, 6]` → 4 edges
   - `10: [0, 1, 5, 6, 8]` → 5 edges
   - `11: [13, 16, 18, 19, 20]` → 5 edges
   - `12: [13, 14, 15, 16, 19]` → 5 edges
   - `13: [11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20]` → 7 edges
   - `14: [4, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20]` → 7 edges
   - `15: [12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20]` → 7 edges
   - `16: [11, 12, 13, 19]` → 4 edges
   - `17: [14, 15, 18, 20]` → 4 edges
   - `18: [11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20]` → 7 edges
   - `19: [4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18]` → 8 edges
   - `20: [11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18]` → 6 edges

   Total sum = 114.

2. Divide the total by 2 to account for double counting:
   - `114 / 2 = 57`.

Thus, the graph has 57 edges.
