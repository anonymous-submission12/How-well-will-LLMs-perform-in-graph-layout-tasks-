To count the number of edges in the graph represented by the adjacency list, we need to sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide the total by 2 (since each edge is counted twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists:
   ```
   0: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] -> 5
   1: [3, 4, 6] -> 3
   2: [0, 3, 5, 6] -> 4
   3: [0, 1, 2, 5, 6] -> 5
   4: [0, 1, 5] -> 3
   5: [0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11] -> 6
   6: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 17] -> 6
   7: [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] -> 6
   8: [7, 9, 10, 11, 13] -> 5
   9: [7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13] -> 6
   10: [7, 8, 9, 11, 13] -> 5
   11: [5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 18] -> 8
   12: [7, 9, 11, 13] -> 4
   13: [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] -> 6
   14: [16, 17, 18, 19, 20] -> 5
   15: [16, 17, 18, 19, 20] -> 5
   16: [14, 15, 17, 18, 19] -> 5
   17: [6, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20] -> 7
   18: [11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20] -> 7
   19: [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20] -> 6
   20: [14, 15, 17, 18, 19] -> 5
   ```

   Total sum = 5 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 3 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 8 + 4 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 118

2. Divide the total by 2 to account for double counting:
   ```
   Number of edges = 118 / 2 = 59
   ```
