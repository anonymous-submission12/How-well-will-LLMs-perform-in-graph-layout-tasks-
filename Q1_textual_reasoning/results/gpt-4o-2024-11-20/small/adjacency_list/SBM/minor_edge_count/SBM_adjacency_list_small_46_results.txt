To count the number of edges in the graph, we will sum up the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide the total by 2 (since each edge is represented twice in an undirected graph).

Hereâ€™s the calculation:
- Sum of all adjacency list lengths:  
  \(7 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 86\)  
- Total number of edges: \(86 / 2 = 43\)

Here is the JSON response:
