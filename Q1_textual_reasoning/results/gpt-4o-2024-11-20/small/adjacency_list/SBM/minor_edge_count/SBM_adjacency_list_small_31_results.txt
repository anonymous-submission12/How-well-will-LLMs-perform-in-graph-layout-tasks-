To count the number of edges in the graph represented by an adjacency list, note that each edge is represented twice (once in each connected vertex's list). The total number of edges is thus half the sum of the lengths of all adjacency lists.

Here is the count:

### Calculation:
1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists:
   - `0: 11, 1: 11, 2: 13, 3: 8, 4: 10, 5: 10, 6: 8, 7: 11, 8: 8, 9: 11, 10: 10, 11: 9, 12: 10, 13: 10, 14: 12, 15: 10, 16: 11, 17: 11, 18: 7, 19: 8, 20: 7, 21: 11, 22: 13, 23: 7, 24: 11, 25: 10, 26: 9, 27: 11`
   - Total sum = `11 + 11 + 13 + 8 + 10 + 10 + 8 + 11 + 8 + 11 + 10 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 12 + 10 + 11 + 11 + 7 + 8 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 7 + 11 + 10 + 9 + 11 = 243`.

2. Divide the total sum by 2 to account for double-counting:
   - `243 รท 2 = 121.5`, round down to get an integer (only edges are counted fully).
   =244 won't edge.
