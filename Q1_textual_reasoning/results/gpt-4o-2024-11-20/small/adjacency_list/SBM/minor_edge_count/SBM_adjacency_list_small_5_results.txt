To count the number of edges in the graph represented by the adjacency list, we sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide the total by 2 (since each edge is counted twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists:
   ```
   4 + 4 + 5 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 = 96
   ```

2. Divide the total by 2 to account for double counting:
   ```
   96 / 2 = 48
   ```

Thus, the graph has 48 edges.
