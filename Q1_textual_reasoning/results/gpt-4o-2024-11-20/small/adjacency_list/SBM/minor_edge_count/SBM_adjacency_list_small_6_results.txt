To count the number of edges in the graph, we iterate through the adjacency list and sum up the lengths of each node's neighbor list, dividing the total by 2 to avoid double-counting (since each edge appears twice in an undirected graph).

Letâ€™s perform the calculation.

### Calculation Steps:
1. Sum up the lengths of all neighbor lists.
2. Divide the total by 2 to account for double-counted edges.

The adjacency list is provided as:
```json
{0: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 1: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2: [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6], 3: [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6], 4: [0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 24], 5: [0, 1, 2, 3, 6], 6: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 7: [8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 8: [7, 12], 9: [7, 10, 11], 10: [7, 9, 11, 12], 11: [7, 9, 10, 12], 12: [7, 8, 10, 11, 24], 13: [16, 17], 14: [15, 16, 17, 18], 15: [14, 16], 16: [13, 14, 15, 17], 17: [13, 14, 16, 18], 18: [14, 17, 23], 19: [21, 22, 23], 20: [21, 22, 24], 21: [19, 20, 22, 23, 24], 22: [19, 20, 21, 23, 24], 23: [18, 19, 21, 22, 24], 24: [4, 12, 20, 21, 22, 23]}
```

Neighbor counts for each node are as follows:
- Sum of all neighbor counts = 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 6 = 108.

### Total edges:
- Divide total neighbor counts by 2: \( \frac{108}{2} = 54 \).

### JSON result:
```json
{
  "answer": 54
}
```
