To count the number of edges in the graph represented by the adjacency list, we need to sum up the lengths of all the adjacency lists for each vertex and divide by 2 (since each edge is represented twice in an undirected graph).

Let's calculate:

### Calculation:
```plaintext
Sum of adjacency lists lengths:
Lengths = [3, 5, 4, 4, 2, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 3, 3, 4, 4]
Sum = 93

Number of edges = Sum / 2 = 93 / 2 = 46
```

### Result:
```json
{
  "answer": 46
}
```
