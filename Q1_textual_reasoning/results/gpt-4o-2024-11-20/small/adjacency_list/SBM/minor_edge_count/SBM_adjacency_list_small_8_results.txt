To count the number of edges in the graph represented by the adjacency list, we sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide the total by 2 (since each edge is counted twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists:
   ```
   9 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 10 + 7 + 7 + 8 + 8 + 7 + 9 + 5 + 8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 5 + 8 + 9 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 8 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 4 = 164
   ```

2. Divide the total by 2 to account for double counting:
   ```
   164 / 2 = 82
   ```

Thus, the graph has 82 edges.

Here is the JSON response:
