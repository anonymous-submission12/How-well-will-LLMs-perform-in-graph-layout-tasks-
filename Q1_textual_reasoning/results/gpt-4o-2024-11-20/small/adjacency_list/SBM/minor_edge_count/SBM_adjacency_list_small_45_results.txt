To count the number of edges in the graph represented by the adjacency list, we need to sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide the total by 2 (since each edge is counted twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists:
   ```
   4 (0) + 3 (1) + 5 (2) + 4 (3) + 5 (4) + 4 (5) + 5 (6) + 6 (7) + 5 (8) + 4 (9) + 5 (10) + 5 (11) + 3 (12) + 5 (13) + 4 (14) + 4 (15) + 4 (16) + 5 (17) + 4 (18) + 4 (19) + 4 (20) + 5 (21) + 6 (22) + 5 (23) = 100
   ```

2. Divide the total by 2 to account for double counting:
   ```
   100 / 2 = 50
   ```

Thus, the graph has 50 edges.
