To count the number of edges in the graph represented by the adjacency list, we calculate the total number of connections provided in the list and then divide it by 2 because each edge is represented twice in an adjacency list (once for each vertex).

Here is the calculation and response:

**Step-by-step**:
1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists (i.e., count all connections).
2. Since each edge is counted twice, divide the total count by 2 to get the number of unique edges.
