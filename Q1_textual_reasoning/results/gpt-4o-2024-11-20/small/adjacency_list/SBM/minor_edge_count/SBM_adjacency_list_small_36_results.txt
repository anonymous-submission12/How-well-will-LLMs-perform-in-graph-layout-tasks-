To count the number of edges in the graph represented by the adjacency list, we need to sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide the total by 2 (since each edge is counted twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

1. Sum of all adjacency lists:
   ```
   6 (0) + 6 (1) + 6 (2) + 7 (3) + 5 (4) + 5 (5) + 6 (6) + 7 (7) +
   5 (8) + 6 (9) + 6 (10) + 6 (11) + 6 (12) + 6 (13) + 5 (14) + 5 (15) +
   5 (16) + 3 (17) + 3 (18) + 4 (19) + 4 (20) + 7 (21) + 6 (22) = 120
   ```

2. Divide the total by 2 to account for double-counting:
   ```
   120 / 2 = 60
   ```

Thus, the graph has 60 edges.
