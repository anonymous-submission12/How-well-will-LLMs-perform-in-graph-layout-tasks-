To calculate the degree of each node in the graph provided as `adjacency_list`, we count the number of connections for each node. The degree of node `0` is the highest because it is connected to every other node.

Node `0` is connected to 23 nodes: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]`. Its degree is thus `23`.

All other nodes are only connected to `0`, giving them a degree of `1`.

The highest degree in the graph is therefore **23**.
