To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of connections (edges) each node has. The degree of a node is the count of its neighbors in the adjacency list.

Here is the calculation:

- Node `0` has connections to nodes `[1, 2, 3, ..., 28]`, which means it has a degree of `28`.
- All other nodes (`1` to `28`) are connected only to node `0`, so each of them has a degree of `1`.

The highest degree in the graph is `28`.
