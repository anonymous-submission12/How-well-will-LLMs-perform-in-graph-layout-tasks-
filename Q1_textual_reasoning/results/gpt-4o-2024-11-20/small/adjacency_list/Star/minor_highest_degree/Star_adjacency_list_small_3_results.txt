Hereâ€™s the calculation:

The graph is represented by an adjacency list format. To determine the highest degree, we calculate the degree for every node by counting its neighbors. Specifically:
- Node `0` connects to 22 other nodes, so its degree is `22`.
- All other nodes (`1` to `22`) connect only to node `0`, their degree is `1`.

Thus, the highest degree in this graph is `22` (from node `0`).
