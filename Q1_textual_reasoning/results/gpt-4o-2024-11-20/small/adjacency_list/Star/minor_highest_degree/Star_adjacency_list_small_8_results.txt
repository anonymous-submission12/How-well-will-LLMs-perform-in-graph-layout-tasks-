To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of edges connected to each node. The degree of a node is the length of its adjacency list.

Here is the calculation:

- Node `0` is connected to 27 other nodes, so its degree is `27`.
- All other nodes (`1` through `27`) are only connected to node `0`, so their degree is `1`.

The highest degree in the graph is `27`.

Here is the JSON response:
