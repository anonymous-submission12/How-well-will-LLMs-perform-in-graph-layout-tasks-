To calculate the shortest path between node '4' and node '12', we can observe the graph structure provided in the adjacency list. The graph is a star graph where node '0' is the central node connected to all other nodes, and all other nodes are only connected to node '0'. 

The shortest path between node '4' and node '12' involves traveling from node '4' to node '0' and then from node '0' to node '12'. This path has a length of 2.
