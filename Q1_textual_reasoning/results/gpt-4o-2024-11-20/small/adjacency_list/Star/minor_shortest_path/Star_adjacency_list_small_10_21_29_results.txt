To calculate the shortest path between node '21' and '29', we can observe the graph structure. The graph is a star graph where node '0' is the central node connected to all other nodes, and all other nodes are only connected to node '0'. Therefore, the shortest path between any two nodes (e.g., '21' and '29') must pass through node '0'.

The shortest path from '21' to '29' is:
- From '21' to '0' (1 step)
- From '0' to '29' (1 step)

Thus, the total length of the shortest path is 2.
