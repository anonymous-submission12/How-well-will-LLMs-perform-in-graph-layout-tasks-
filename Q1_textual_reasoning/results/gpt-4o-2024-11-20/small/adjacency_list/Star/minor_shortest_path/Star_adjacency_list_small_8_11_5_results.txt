The graph described in the adjacency_list format is a star graph, where node 0 serves as the central hub connected to all other nodes. Each non-central node (from 1 to 27) is connected only to node 0 and not directly to other nodes.

To calculate the shortest path between node '11' and node '5':
1. Node '11' connects to node '0'.
2. Node '0' connects to node '5'.

This means the shortest path from '11' to '5' will pass through the central node '0' and includes 2 edges: one from '11' to '0' and another from '0' to '5'.

Thus, the shortest path length is **2**.
