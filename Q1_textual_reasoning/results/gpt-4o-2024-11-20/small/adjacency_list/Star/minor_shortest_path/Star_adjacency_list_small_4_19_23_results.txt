To calculate the shortest path between nodes '19' and '23', we can see from the adjacency list that both nodes are directly connected to the central node '0'. This forms a star graph structure, where the central node '0' connects to all other nodes.

The shortest path between '19' and '23' will involve going through node '0':
1. From '19' to '0' (1 step)
2. From '0' to '23' (1 step)

Thus, the total length of the shortest path is 2.
