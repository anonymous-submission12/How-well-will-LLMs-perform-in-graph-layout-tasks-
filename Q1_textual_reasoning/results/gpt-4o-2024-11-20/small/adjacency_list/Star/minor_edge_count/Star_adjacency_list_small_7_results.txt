To count the number of edges in the graph, we can sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide by 2 (since each edge is represented twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

- Node `0` has 26 neighbors.
- Nodes `1` through `26` each have 1 neighbor (node `0`).

Total edges = (26 + 1 + 1 + ... + 1) / 2 = (26 + 26) / 2 = 26.

Here is the JSON response:

  "answer": 26
