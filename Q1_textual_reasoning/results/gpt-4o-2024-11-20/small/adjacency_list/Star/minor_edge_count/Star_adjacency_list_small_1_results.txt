To count the number of edges in the graph, we follow these steps:

1. Loop through each node in the adjacency list and count its neighbors.
2. Since the graph is undirected, each edge is counted twice (once at each of its two nodes). To get the correct number of edges, we divide the total count by 2.

**Graph details:**
The adjacency list given indicates that node `0` is connected to every other node (nodes `1 through 20`), and each of these nodes is only connected back to `0`, forming a star graph.

- Node `0` has 20 neighbors, contributing 20 edges.
- Nodes `1 through 20` each point back to node `0`, but these edges are already accounted for in node `0`'s list.
- Total edges = 20 (without double-counting).
