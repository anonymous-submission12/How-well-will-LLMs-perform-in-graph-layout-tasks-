To count the number of edges in the graph, we can sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide by 2 (since each edge is represented twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

- Node `0` has 27 neighbors.
- Each of the other nodes (`1` to `27`) has only `0` as a neighbor.

The total number of edges is:
\[
\text{Total edges} = \frac{\text{Sum of all adjacency list lengths}}{2} = \frac{27 + 27}{2} = 27
\]

Here is the JSON response:
