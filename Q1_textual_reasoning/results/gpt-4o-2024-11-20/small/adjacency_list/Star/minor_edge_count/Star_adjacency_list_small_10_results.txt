To count the number of edges in the graph, we can sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide by 2 (since each edge is represented twice in an undirected graph). Here's the calculation:

- Node `0` has 29 neighbors.
- Each of the other nodes (`1` to `29`) has only 1 neighbor (node `0`).

Total edges = (29 + 1 + 1 + ... + 1) / 2 = (29 + 29) / 2 = 29.

Here is the JSON response:
