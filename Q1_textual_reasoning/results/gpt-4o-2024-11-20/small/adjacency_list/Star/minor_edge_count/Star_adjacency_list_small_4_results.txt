To count the number of edges in the graph, we can sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide by 2 (since each edge is represented twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

- Node `0` has 23 neighbors, contributing 23 edges.
- Nodes `1` through `23` each have 1 neighbor (node `0`), contributing 23 edges.

Total edges = (23 + 23) / 2 = 23.

Here is the JSON response:
