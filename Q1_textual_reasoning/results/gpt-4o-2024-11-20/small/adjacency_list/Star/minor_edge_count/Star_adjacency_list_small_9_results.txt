To count the number of edges in the graph:

1. The adjacency list provided indicates connections (edges) between the nodes.
2. Each edge is listed twice in an undirected graph (once for each node it connects).

With this logic, the total count of edges is simply the sum of the lengths of the adjacency lists for all nodes divided by 2.

### Calculation:
- Node `0` connects to 28 nodes (1 to 28): 28 edges.
- Nodes `1` through `28` each connect only to node `0`: 1 edge per node.

Sum of degrees: \( 28 + 1 \times 28 = 56 \).

To count edges in an undirected graph, divide the sum by \(2\): \( 56 / 2 = 28 \).

### Result:
