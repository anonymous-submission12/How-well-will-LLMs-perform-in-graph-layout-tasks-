To count the number of edges in the graph, we can iterate through the adjacency list and count the number of edges. Adjacency lists represent bidirectional edges twice (once for each vertex), so we need to divide the count by 2 to get the correct number.

Below is the count:

- Vertex `0` has connections to 21 vertices (`1` to `21`), totaling 21 edges.
- Vertices `1` through `21` each have connections only to vertex `0`. These edges have already been counted in vertex `0`'s adjacency list.

Thus, the total number of unique edges in this graph is 21.
