To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph provided using the adjacency list:

- We determine the degree of each node by counting the number of edges it has (i.e., the length of the adjacency list for each node).
- Then, we find the maximum degree among all nodes.

Here is the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
```

Explanation:
- Every node in the graph appears to connect to at most two other nodes, indicating that the graph is a linear chain. Hence, the maximum degree is 2.
