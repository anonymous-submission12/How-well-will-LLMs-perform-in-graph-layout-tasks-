To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of connections (edges) each node has and find the maximum value.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph is structured as a linear chain, where most nodes (except the first and last) have exactly 2 connections.
- The first node (0) and the last node (23) each have only 1 connection.
- Therefore, the highest degree in the graph is 2.
