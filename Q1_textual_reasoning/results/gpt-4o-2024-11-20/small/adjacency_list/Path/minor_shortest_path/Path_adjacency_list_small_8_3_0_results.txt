To determine the shortest path length between nodes '3' and '0', the graph is essentially a linear chain. We can compute the path length by counting the number of edges between the two nodes.

From the adjacency list, observe that the path between '3' and '0' involves traversing nodes '3 → 2 → 1 → 0'. This makes the distance equal to 3.
