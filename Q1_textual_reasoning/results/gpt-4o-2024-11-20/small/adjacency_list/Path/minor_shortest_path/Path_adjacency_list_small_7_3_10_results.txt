To calculate the shortest path between nodes '3' and '10' in the given graph, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The graph is represented as an adjacency list, and the BFS algorithm will find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 7
}
```

Explanation:
- The shortest path from node '3' to node '10' is: 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10.
- This path has a length of 7.
