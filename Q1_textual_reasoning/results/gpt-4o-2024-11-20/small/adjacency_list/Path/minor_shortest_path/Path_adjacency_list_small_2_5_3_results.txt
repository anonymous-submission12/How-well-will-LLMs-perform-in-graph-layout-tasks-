To calculate the shortest path between node '5' and '3', we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS). Here's the solution:

1. The graph is linear, with nodes connected sequentially.
2. BFS starts at node '5' and explores its neighbors until it finds node '3'.
3. The shortest path is the count of edges traversed.

Now, let's calculate:

- From node '5', move to '4' and then '3'. This results in a total of 2 edges.
