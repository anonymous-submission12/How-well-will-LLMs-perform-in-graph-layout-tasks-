To calculate the shortest path between nodes '5' and '15', we can observe that the graph provided represents a linear structure (a sequence of nodes connected sequentially from 0 to 22). In this case, the shortest path is the number of edges between node '5' and node '15'.

The graph is sequential, so the shortest path length can be computed as the absolute difference between the indices of the two nodes:
```
Shortest path length = |15 - 5| = 10
```
