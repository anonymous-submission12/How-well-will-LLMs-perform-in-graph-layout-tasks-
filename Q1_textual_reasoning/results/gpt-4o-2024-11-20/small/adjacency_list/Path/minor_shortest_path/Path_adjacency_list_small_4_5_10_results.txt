To compute the length of the shortest path between node '5' and node '10', we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS). Since the graph data represents a simple, unweighted structure where nodes are connected sequentially, the solution will calculate the shortest path step-by-step.

### Execution to find shortest path:
1. Start BFS from node '5'.
2. Traverse the graph until node '10' is reached.
3. Count the length of the path.

The shortest path from node '5' to node '10' involves moving sequentially through nodes in order: `5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10`. This traversal includes **5 edges**.
