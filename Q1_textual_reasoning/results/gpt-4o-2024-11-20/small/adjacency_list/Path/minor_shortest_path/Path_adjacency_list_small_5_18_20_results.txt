To calculate the shortest path between nodes '18' and '20', we can observe that the graph is structured as a linear chain. Each node is connected to its immediate neighbors, and the shortest path between any two nodes is simply the difference in their indices.

The shortest path between node '18' and node '20' is:

\[
\text{Length} = |20 - 18| = 2
\]
