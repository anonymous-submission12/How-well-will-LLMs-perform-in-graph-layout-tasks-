To calculate the shortest path between node '9' and node '1', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The graph is linear, so the shortest path is simply the difference in indices between the two nodes.

Node '9' is at index 9, and node '1' is at index 1. The shortest path length is:

\[
\text{Shortest Path Length} = |9 - 1| = 8
\]
