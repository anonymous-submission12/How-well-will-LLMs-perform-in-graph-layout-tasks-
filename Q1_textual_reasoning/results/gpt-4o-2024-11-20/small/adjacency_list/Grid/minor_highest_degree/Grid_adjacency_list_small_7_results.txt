To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of connections (edges) each node has and find the maximum among them. The degree of a node is simply the length of its adjacency list.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph is represented as an adjacency list.
- For each node, the degree is the length of its adjacency list.
- The highest degree in the graph is 4, which is the degree of nodes like 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.
