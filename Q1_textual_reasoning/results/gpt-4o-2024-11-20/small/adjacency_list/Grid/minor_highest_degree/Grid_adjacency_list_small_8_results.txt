To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of connections (edges) each node has and find the maximum among them.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

Explanation:
- The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.
- In the given adjacency list, each node has either 2 or 3 connections.
- The highest degree among all nodes is 3.
