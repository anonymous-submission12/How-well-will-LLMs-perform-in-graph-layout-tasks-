To determine the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we calculate the degree of each node by counting its neighbors. The degree is essentially the size of the list associated with each node in the adjacency list. Let's calculate:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

In this graph, the maximum degree among all nodes is 4, which corresponds to nodes like `6`, `7`, `8`, `11`, `12`, `13`, `16`, `17`, `18`, etc.
