To count the number of edges in the graph, we can sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide the total by 2 (since each edge is represented twice in the adjacency list). Here's the calculation:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists:
   ```
   2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 84
   ```

2. Divide the total by 2 to get the number of edges:
   ```
   84 / 2 = 42
   ```

Thus, the graph has 42 edges.

Here is the JSON response:
