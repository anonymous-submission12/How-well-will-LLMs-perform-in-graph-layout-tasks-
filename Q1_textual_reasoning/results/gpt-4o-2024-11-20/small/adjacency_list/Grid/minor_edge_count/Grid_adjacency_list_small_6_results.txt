To count the number of edges in the graph, we can sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide by 2 (since each edge is counted twice in an undirected graph). Here's the calculation:

1. Sum of all adjacency list lengths:
   - \(2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 72\)

2. Divide by 2 to get the number of unique edges:
   - \(72 / 2 = 36\)
