To count the number of edges in the graph represented by the adjacency list, we can sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide the total by 2 (since each edge is counted twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists:
   - `len([1, 5]) = 2`
   - `len([0, 2, 6]) = 3`
   - `len([1, 3, 7]) = 3`
   - `len([2, 4, 8]) = 3`
   - `len([3, 9]) = 2`
   - `len([0, 6, 10]) = 3`
   - `len([1, 5, 7, 11]) = 4`
   - `len([2, 6, 8, 12]) = 4`
   - `len([3, 7, 9, 13]) = 4`
   - `len([4, 8, 14]) = 3`
   - `len([5, 11, 15]) = 3`
   - `len([6, 10, 12, 16]) = 4`
   - `len([7, 11, 13, 17]) = 4`
   - `len([8, 12, 14, 18]) = 4`
   - `len([9, 13, 19]) = 3`
   - `len([10, 16, 20]) = 3`
   - `len([11, 15, 17, 21]) = 4`
   - `len([12, 16, 18, 22]) = 4`
   - `len([13, 17, 19, 23]) = 4`
   - `len([14, 18, 24]) = 3`
   - `len([15, 21]) = 2`
   - `len([16, 20, 22]) = 3`
   - `len([17, 21, 23]) = 3`
   - `len([18, 22, 24]) = 3`
   - `len([19, 23]) = 2`

   Total sum = 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 80.

2. Divide the total by 2 to account for double counting:
   - `80 / 2 = 40`.

Thus, the graph has 40 edges.
