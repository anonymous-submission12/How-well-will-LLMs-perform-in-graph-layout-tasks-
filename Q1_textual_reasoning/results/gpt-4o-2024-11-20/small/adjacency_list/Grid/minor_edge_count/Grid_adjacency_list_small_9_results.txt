To count the number of edges in the graph, we can sum up the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide the total by 2 (since each edge is counted twice in an undirected graph). Here's the calculation:

1. Sum of all adjacency list lengths:
   - `len([1, 7]) + len([0, 2, 8]) + len([1, 3, 9]) + ... + len([13, 19])`
   - This equals `2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 64`.

2. Divide the total by 2 to account for double-counting:
   - `64 / 2 = 32`.

Thus, the graph has 32 edges.
