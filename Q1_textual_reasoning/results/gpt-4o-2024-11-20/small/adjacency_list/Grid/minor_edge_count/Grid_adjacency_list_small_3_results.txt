To count the number of edges in the graph, we can iterate through the adjacency list and sum up the lengths of all the lists. Since each edge is represented twice (once for each vertex it connects), we divide the total count by 2 to get the actual number of edges.

Here is the calculation:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists:
   - `len([1, 12]) + len([0, 2, 13]) + len([1, 3, 14]) + ... + len([11, 22]) = 48`

2. Divide the total by 2 to account for double counting:
   - `48 / 2 = 24`

Thus, the graph has 24 edges.
