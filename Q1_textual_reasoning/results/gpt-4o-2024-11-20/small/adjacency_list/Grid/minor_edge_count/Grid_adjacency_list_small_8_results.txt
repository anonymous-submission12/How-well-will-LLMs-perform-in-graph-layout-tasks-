To count the number of edges in the graph, we can sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide the total by 2 (since each edge is represented twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists:
   - `len([1, 14]) + len([0, 2, 15]) + len([1, 3, 16]) + ... + len([13, 26])`
   - This gives a total of 84.

2. Divide the total by 2 to account for double counting:
   - `84 / 2 = 42`

Thus, the graph has **42 edges**.
