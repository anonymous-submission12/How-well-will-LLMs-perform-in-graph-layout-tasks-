To count the number of edges in the graph, we can sum up the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide the total by 2 (since each edge is counted twice in an undirected graph). Here's the calculation:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists:
   - For example, vertex 0 has 2 neighbors, vertex 1 has 3 neighbors, and so on.

2. Divide the total by 2 to account for double-counting.

Now, let's compute the result:
