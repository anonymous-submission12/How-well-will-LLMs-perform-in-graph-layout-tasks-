To calculate the length of the shortest path between nodes '1' and '3' in the provided graph, I will use Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is well-suited for finding shortest paths in an unweighted graph. 

### Explanation
1. Use BFS starting from node '1'.
2. Traverse the graph layer by layer while keeping track of visited nodes and their distances from the start.
3. Stop when node '3' is encountered and return the distance.

### Code Execution
After performing the BFS calculation, here's the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
```
