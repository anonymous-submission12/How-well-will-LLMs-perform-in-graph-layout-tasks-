To calculate the shortest path between nodes '19' and '16' in the given graph, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
1. Start BFS from node '19'.
2. Explore its neighbors: '5', '18', and '20'.
3. From these neighbors, continue exploring their neighbors until node '16' is reached.
4. The shortest path from '19' to '16' is: 19 → 18 → 17 → 16, which has a length of 3.
