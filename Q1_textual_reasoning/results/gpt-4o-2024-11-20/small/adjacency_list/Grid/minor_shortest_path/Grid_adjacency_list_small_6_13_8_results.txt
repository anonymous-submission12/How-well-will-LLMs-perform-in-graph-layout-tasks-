To calculate the shortest path between node '13' and node '8', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS ensures the shortest path in terms of the number of edges in an unweighted graph.

Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 5
}
```

Explanation:
Using BFS, the shortest path from node '13' to node '8' is:
- Start at node '13' → move to node '12'
- Node '12' → move to node '11'
- Node '11' → move to node '10'
- Node '10' → move to node '9'
- Node '9' → move to node '8'

Hence, the shortest path length is 5 edges.
