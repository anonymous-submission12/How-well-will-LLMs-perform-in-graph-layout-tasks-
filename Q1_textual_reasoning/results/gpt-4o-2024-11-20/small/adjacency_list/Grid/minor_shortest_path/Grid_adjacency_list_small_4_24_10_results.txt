To calculate the shortest path between nodes `24` and `10` in the given graph, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 6
}
```

### Explanation:
1. Start BFS from node `24`.
2. Traverse the graph level by level, keeping track of visited nodes and the distance from the starting node.
3. Stop when node `10` is reached.
4. The shortest path from `24` to `10` is of length `6`. The path is: `24 -> 23 -> 22 -> 21 -> 20 -> 19 -> 10`.
