To determine the shortest path length between nodes '8' and '0', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm because it effectively finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Let's calculate it:

### Step-by-step BFS
1. Start with node `8`.
2. Explore all its immediate neighbors and keep track of visited nodes.
3. Continue exploring neighbors level by level until reaching node `0`.
4. Count the levels traversed, which will represent the shortest path length.

### Traverse Adjacency List
The adjacency list for the graph is provided. Using BFS, we compute the shortest path.

### Solution
Using BFS, we find that the shortest path from node `8` to node `0` has a length of **8**.
