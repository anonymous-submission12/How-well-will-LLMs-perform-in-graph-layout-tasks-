To determine the shortest path length between nodes `27` and `19`, we can utilize the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's the computation and the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

Explanation:
- Starting at node `27`, progress step-by-step to reach node `19` via the BFS algorithm:
  - From `27`: neighbors `[21, 26, 28]`.
  - From these neighbors, continue until visiting `19` in 4 steps (`27 -> 26 -> 25 -> 19`).
