To compute the shortest path between node '17' and '36', I will model this graph as a network and use breadth-first search (BFS). Here is the JSON response with the shortest path length:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

This result indicates that the shortest path between node '17' and node '36' has a length of 4 edges.
