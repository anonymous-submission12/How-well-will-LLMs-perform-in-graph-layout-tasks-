To calculate the shortest path between node '5' and node '27', we can treat the graph as an unweighted graph and use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Let's process the edge list.

After analyzing the graph, the shortest path length between node '5' and node '27' is **6**.

Here is the JSON response:
