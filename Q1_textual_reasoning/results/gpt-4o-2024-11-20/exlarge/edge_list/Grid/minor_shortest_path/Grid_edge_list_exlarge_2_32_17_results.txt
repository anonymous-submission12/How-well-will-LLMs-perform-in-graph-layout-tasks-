To calculate the shortest path between nodes `32` and `17` in the graph provided in edge list format, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here's the JSON answer:

  "answer": 2
}
```

### Explanation:

1. Node `32` connects directly to `16` and `48`.
2. Node `16` connects directly to `17`.
3. Therefore, the shortest path from `32` to `17` is: `32 -> 16 -> 17`, requiring **2 steps**.
