To calculate the highest degree in the graph given in the edge list, we first compute the degree (number of connections) of each node and then find the maximum degree.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

Explanation:
- Each node in the graph represents a vertex, and the edges represent connections.
- Using the edge list, we count how many times each node appears (represents the degree of the node).
- The node with the maximum number of connections has a degree of 4 in this graph.
