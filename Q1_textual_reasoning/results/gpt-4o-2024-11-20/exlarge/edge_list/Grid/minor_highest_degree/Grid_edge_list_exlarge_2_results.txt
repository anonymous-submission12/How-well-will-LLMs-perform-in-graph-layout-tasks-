To find the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to calculate the degree (number of edges connected) of each node from the given edge list, and then determine the maximum degree among them.

### Steps:
1. Parse the edge list to count the degree of each node.
2. Identify the node with the maximum degree.

Here is the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

The highest degree of all nodes in the graph is 4.
