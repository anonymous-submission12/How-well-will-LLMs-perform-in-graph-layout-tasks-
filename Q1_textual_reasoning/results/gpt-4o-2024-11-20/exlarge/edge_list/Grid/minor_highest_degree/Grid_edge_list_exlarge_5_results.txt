To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we first compute the degree of each node. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.

Here is the result wrapped in a JSON object:

```json
{
  "answer": 6
}
```

### Explanation:

1. Parse the edges list [(0, 1), (0, 12), (1, 2), ...].
2. Count the number of edges connected to each node:
   - Node degrees are as follows:
     - For example, node 0 has edges (0,1) and (0,12), so its degree is 2.
   - Some nodes are connected to more edges and have higher degrees.
3. Maximum degree:
   - By inspecting the counts, the highest degree is **6**. This occurs for several nodes, including nodes like 13 and others.
