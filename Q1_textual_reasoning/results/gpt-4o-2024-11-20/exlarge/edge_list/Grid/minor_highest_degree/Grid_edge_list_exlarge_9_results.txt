To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the provided graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. The degree of a node is the count of edges incident to it. Let's calculate the degree of each node and find the maximum degree.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

### Explanation:
- From the given `edge_list`, the node with the **highest degree** is one of the central nodes. For example, nodes `0`, `1`, `2` (and others in that cycle) experience **exactly 3 distinct...
