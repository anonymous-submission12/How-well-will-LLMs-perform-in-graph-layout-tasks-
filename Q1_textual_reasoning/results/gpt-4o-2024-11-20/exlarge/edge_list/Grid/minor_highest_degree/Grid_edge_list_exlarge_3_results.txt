To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the provided graph, we will compute the degree of each node. The degree of a node is the number of edges incident to it.

Here is the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

Explanation:
- In this graph, nodes such as `1`, `19`, etc., have the highest degree of 4 because they are connected to 4 other nodes.
