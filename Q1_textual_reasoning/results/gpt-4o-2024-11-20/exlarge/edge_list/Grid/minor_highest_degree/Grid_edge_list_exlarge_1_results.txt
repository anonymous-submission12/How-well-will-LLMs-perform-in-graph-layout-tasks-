To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph represented by the edge list, we compute the degree of each node (i.e., count the number of edges connected to each node). Here's the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

Explanation:
- The node with the highest degree is `25`, `26`, `27`, ..., all the way to `48`, having 4 connections due to edges between layers as well as horizontally within columns.
