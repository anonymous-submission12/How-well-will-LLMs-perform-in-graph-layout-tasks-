To determine the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, I will calculate the degree (number of edges connected) for each node from the given edge list and return the highest degree.

### Process:
1. Parse the edge list.
2. Create a dictionary to track the degree of each node.
3. Count the edges connected to each node.
4. Find the maximum degree.
