To calculate the number of nodes in the graph, we need to consider all unique node values from the edge list. In the provided edge list, each edge is represented as a pair of nodes (u, v). By extracting all unique nodes:

Nodes involved: {0, 1, 2, ..., 74}  
As the node labels range from 0 through 74, there are 75 unique nodes. 

Here is the result in the requested JSON format:
