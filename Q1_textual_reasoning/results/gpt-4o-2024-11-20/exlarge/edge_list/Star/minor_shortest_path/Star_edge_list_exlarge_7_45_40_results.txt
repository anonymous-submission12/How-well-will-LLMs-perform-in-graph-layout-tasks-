The graph provided is in the format of an edge list, and it represents a star graph, where all nodes (0, 1, 2, ..., 76) are connected to the central node "0". Since all nodes are directly connected to the central node "0", the shortest path length between any two nodes (e.g., "45" and "40") will always go through the central node "0" with a distance of 2.
