To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest path between nodes '68' and '30' in the graph represented by the edge list. 

### Analysis of the Graph
The provided graph consists of many edges originating from node `0`, making it a star graph. In a star graph, every other node is directly connected to the central node (node `0`). Thus, any path between two non-central nodes, such as between '68' and '30', must pass through the central node.

### Path Calculation
The shortest path between '68' and '30' in this star graph requires:
1. A step from '68' to the central node (`0`).
2. A step from the central node (`0`) to '30'.

This results in a total path length of **2**.
