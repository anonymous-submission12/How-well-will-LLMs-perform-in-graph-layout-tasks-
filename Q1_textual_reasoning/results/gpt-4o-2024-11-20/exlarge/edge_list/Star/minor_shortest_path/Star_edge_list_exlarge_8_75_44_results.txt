The provided graph is defined as an edge list where all nodes (1 through 77) are directly connected to node 0. This forms a star graph, with node 0 at the center. The shortest path between any two nodes in a star graph passes through the center node.

To compute the shortest path between nodes '75' and '44':
1. From 75 to 0 = 1 step.
2. From 0 to 44 = 1 step.

Thus, the total path length is \(1 + 1 = 2\).
