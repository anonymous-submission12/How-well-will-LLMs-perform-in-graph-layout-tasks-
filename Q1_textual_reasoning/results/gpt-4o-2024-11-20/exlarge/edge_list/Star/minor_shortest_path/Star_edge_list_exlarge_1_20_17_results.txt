The graph you provided is essentially a star graph, where node '0' is the central node connected to all other nodes (1â€“70). Since all nodes are directly connected to node '0', the shortest path between any two nodes will always go through node '0'. Therefore, the shortest path between node '20' and node '17' will have a length of 2 (from '20' to '0', then from '0' to '17').
