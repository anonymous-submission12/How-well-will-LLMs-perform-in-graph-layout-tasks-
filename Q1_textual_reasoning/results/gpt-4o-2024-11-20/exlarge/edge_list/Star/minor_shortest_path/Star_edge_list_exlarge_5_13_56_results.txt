To calculate the shortest path between node `13` and `56` in the given graph, we first understand its structure. The graph is defined as an edge list of connections to the central node `0`. Each node (`0, 1, ..., 74`) connects directly to `0`, forming a star graph topology. 

In such a graph:
1. Any two nodes can reach each other through `0`.
2. The shortest path between any pair of nodes, `(a, b)` where `a â‰  b`, is 2: `a -> 0 -> b`.

Thus, the shortest path between `13` and `56` is `2`.
