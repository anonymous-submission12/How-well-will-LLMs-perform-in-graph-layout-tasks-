To solve the problem, it is evident that the graph described in the edge list is a star graph with node `0` as the central hub, connected to all other nodes. In a star graph, the shortest path between any two non-central nodes must go through the central node.

Here is how we calculate the shortest path length between nodes `60` and `8`:
1. From node `60` to the central node `0`, the distance is `1`.
2. From the central node `0` to node `8`, the distance is also `1`.

Adding these two distances, the total shortest path length between node `60` and node `8` is `1 + 1 = 2`.
