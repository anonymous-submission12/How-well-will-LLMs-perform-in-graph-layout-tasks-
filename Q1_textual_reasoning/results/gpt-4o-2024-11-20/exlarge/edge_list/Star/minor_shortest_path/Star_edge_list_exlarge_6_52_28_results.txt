To calculate the shortest path between nodes '52' and '28', we observe that the graph is represented as an edge list. From the edge list, it is clear that node '0' is connected to all other nodes, forming a star graph. In a star graph, the shortest path between any two non-central nodes (e.g., '52' and '28') always passes through the central node ('0').

Thus, the shortest path between node '52' and node '28' is:
- From '52' to '0' (1 step)
- From '0' to '28' (1 step)

Total length of the shortest path = 1 + 1 = 2.
