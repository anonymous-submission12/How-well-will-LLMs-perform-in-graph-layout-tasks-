To solve this problem, we consider the given graph represented as an edge list. The edges indicate that all nodes (0 through 79) are directly connected to node `0`. Thus, the graph forms a star topology where node `0` is the center.

Calculating the shortest path between node `78` and node `69`, we observe:
1. Node `78` connects to node `0`.
2. Node `69` connects to node `0`.
3. The shortest path is: `78 -> 0 -> 69`.

Hence, the shortest path length is `2`.
