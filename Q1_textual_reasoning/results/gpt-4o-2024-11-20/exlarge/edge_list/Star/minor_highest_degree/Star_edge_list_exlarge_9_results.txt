To solve this problem, let's calculate the degree of each node in the provided graph. Here, the degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. From the given edge list, we can observe that node `0` is connected to all other nodes, whereas no other nodes have additional edges beyond their connection to node `0`.

The degree of node `0` corresponds to the total number of edges in the graph, which is the number of unique nodes it connects to in the edge list.

Since node `0` is connected to nodes `1` through `78` (inclusive), there are \(78 - 1 + 1 = 78\) edges connected to node `0`.

Hence, the highest degree of any node in the graph is `78`.

Here is the JSON representation of the answer:
