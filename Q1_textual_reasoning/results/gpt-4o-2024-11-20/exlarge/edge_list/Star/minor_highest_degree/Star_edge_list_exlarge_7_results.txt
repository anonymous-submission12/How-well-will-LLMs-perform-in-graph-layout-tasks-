To determine the highest degree of all nodes in the given graph, we calculate the degree of each node. The degree of a node is equal to the number of edges connected to it.

The given edge list represents connections between nodes. From the data, it's evident that node `0` is connected to all other nodes (`1` through `76`). Thus, node `0` has a degree of `76`, which is the highest degree in the graph.

Here is the JSON response:
