To calculate the shortest path between nodes `31` and `3`, we note that the graph provided is a simple linear path where each node is connected sequentially. The shortest path length between two nodes in such a graph is simply the absolute difference between their labels.

In this case:
- Path from node `31` to node `3`
- Length = |31 - 3| = 28

Here is the response in the required JSON format:
