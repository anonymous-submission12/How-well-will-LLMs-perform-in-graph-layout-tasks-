To calculate the shortest path between node '49' and node '32', letâ€™s analyze the given graph. The graph is a sequential path where each node connects to its next numerical neighbor. The shortest path is simply the difference between the node values themselves in this linear graph structure.

The distance between nodes '49' and '32' is:

Distance = |49 - 32| = 17

Here's the result in the requested JSON format:
