To calculate the shortest path between node '7' and node '39', we can observe that the graph is a linear chain of nodes. Each edge connects consecutive nodes, and the shortest path between any two nodes is simply the difference in their indices.

The shortest path length between node '7' and node '39' is:

\[
\text{Shortest Path Length} = |39 - 7| = 32
\]
