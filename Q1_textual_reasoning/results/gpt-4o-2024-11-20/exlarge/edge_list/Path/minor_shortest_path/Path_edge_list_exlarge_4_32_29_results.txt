To calculate the length of the shortest path between nodes '32' and '29', we observe that the graph provided is a linear graph (a sequence of connected nodes). Nodes are connected consecutively from 0 to 73, meaning there is only one path between any two nodes in this graph.

The shortest path between node '32' and '29' is simply the absolute difference of their node labels. 

\[
\text{Shortest path length} = |32 - 29| = 3
\]
