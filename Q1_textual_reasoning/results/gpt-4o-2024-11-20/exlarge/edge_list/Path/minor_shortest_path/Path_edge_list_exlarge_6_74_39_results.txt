To calculate the shortest path between nodes `74` and `39` in the provided graph, let us observe that the graph is structured as a linear chain. Since the nodes are connected consecutively, the shortest path between any two nodes is simply the difference in their indices.

The shortest path length between `74` and `39` is calculated as:

\[
\text{Length} = |74 - 39| = 35
\]

Here is the JSON response:
