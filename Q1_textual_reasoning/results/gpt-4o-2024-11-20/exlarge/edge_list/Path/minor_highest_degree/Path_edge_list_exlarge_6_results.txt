To find the highest degree of all nodes in the given graph, we need to calculate the number of edges connected to each node. Below is the JSON representation of the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
```

Explanation:
- In the graph represented by the edge list, each node either connects to a maximum of 2 neighbors (except for the first and last nodes, which connect to only one). Therefore, the highest degree of any node is 2.
