Hereâ€™s how we calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the given graph:

1. Parse the edge list.
2. Count the degree of each node (how many edges are connected to it).
3. Identify the maximum degree.

The graph is represented as a list of edges, where each edge is a tuple connecting two nodes. Let's calculate:

#### Calculation:
- Each node typically contributes one degree per occurrence in the edge list.
- The graph edges indicate a simple path with each node (except the endpoints) connecting to exactly two neighbors.
