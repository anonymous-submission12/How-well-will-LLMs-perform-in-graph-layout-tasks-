To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the degree (number of connections) of each node in the given edge list.

The graph represented by your edge list is sequential, meaning each node is connected to at most two other nodes (except the endpoints which have degree 1). Therefore, the maximum degree will be 2.

Here's the JSON:
