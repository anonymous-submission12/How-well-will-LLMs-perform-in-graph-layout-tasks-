The given graph data represents an edge list of a single, linear path. In such a graph, most nodes have a degree of 2 (they connect to two neighbors on either side), except for the two endpoints (node 0 and node 73), which have a degree of 1.

The highest degree of any node in this graph is **2**.

Here's the JSON representation of the result:
