To determine the highest degree of all nodes in the provided graph, we calculate the degree (number of connections) of each node. Below is the resulting JSON with the highest degree:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
```

Explanation:
- The given graph's edges represent a linear chain of nodes (0-78).
- In a linear chain, all nodes except the two endpoints (0 and 78) have a degree of 2.
- The two endpoints (0 and 78) have a degree of 1.
- Therefore, the highest degree is 2.
