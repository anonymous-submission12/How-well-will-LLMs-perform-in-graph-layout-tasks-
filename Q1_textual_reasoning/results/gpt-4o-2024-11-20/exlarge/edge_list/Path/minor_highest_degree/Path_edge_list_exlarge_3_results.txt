To find the highest degree of any node in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node and determine the maximum degree.

### Steps:
1. Parse through the edge list.
2. Count how many times each node appears (each appearance corresponds to an edge).
3. Identify the node with the maximum count.

### Solution:
Let's calculate the highest degree of any node.

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
```

### Explanation:
- This graph is a chain where each node (except the endpoints) is connected to exactly two other nodes. As such, the highest degree of any node is `2`. The endpoints (nodes `0` and `72`) have a degree of `1`.
