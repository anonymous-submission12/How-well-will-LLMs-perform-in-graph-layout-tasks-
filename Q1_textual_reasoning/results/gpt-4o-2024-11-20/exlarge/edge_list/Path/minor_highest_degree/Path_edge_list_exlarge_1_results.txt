To calculate the highest degree among all nodes in the graph, we need to count how many edges are connected to each node. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. For this particular graph structure:

- Each node (except the endpoints of the graph, 0 and 70) connects to exactly two other nodes (its previous and next node).
- The endpoints of the graph, nodes 0 and 70, each connect to only one other node.

Thus, the highest degree is 2, which belongs to all the internal nodes of the graph.
