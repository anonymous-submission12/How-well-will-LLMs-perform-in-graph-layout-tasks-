To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph is a linear chain (path graph) where each node is connected to at most two other nodes, except for the endpoints (nodes 0 and 74), which are connected to only one other node.
- Therefore, the highest degree in the graph is 2.
