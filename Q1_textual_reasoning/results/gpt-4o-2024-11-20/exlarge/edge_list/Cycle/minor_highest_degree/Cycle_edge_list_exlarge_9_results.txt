To find the highest degree of any node in the graph, we first compute the degree of each node (i.e., the number of edges connected to each node).

The given graph is specified as an edge list. Here's how the degrees are computed:
- For every edge (u, v), we add 1 to the degree count for both node u and node v.
- At the end, we find the maximum degree among all nodes.

Let's compute this and store the result in JSON format:
