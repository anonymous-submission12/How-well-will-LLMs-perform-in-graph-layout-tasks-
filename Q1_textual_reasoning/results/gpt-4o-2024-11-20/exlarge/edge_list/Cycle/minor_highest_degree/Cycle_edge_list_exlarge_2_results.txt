To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we analyze the edge list to count the number of connections (degree) each node has. Here's the answer:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

### Explanation
The edge list represents the graph connections. Most nodes have a degree of 2 (connecting to two other nodes), as the majority are part of a simple chain. However, nodes 0 and 71 have a degree of 3 because they serve as endpoints in the chain and are connected by an additional edge between them. Hence, the maximum degree is 3.
