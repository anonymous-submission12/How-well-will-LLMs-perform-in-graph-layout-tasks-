To compute the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we simply calculate the degree (number of edges connected) of each node in the graph and find the maximum value.

For the provided graph (edge list), the degree of node 0 is 2 because it's connected to nodes 1 and 79. Similarly, every other node along the chain has a degree of 2 except for nodes 79, which also has a degree of 2. Thus, the maximum degree of any node in this graph is **2**.
