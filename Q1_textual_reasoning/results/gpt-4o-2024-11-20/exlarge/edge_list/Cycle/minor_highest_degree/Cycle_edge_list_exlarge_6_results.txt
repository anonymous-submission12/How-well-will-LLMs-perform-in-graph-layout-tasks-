To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we first determine the degree of each node. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.

The graph data is given as an edge list. Here's the calculated result:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

### Explanation:

- Node `0` has **2 edges**: `(0, 1)` and `(0, 75)`.
- Node `75` also has **2 edges**: `(0, 75)` and `(74, 75)`.
- Every other node in the graph (from `1` to `74`) has **2 edges**, except for nodes `1` and `74`.
