To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. Here's the calculation:

1. Parse the edge list.
2. Count the occurrences of each node in the edge list.
3. Find the maximum count.

The graph data provided is:

```plaintext
[(0, 1), (0, 74), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26), (26, 27), (27, 28), (28, 29), (29, 30), (30, 31), (31, 32), (32, 33), (33, 34), (34, 35), (35, 36), (36, 37), (37, 38), (38, 39), (39, 40), (40, 41), (41, 42), (42, 43), (43, 44), (44, 45), (45, 46), (46, 47), (47, 48), (48, 49), (49, 50), (50, 51), (51, 52), (52, 53), (53, 54), (54, 55), (55, 56), (56, 57), (57, 58), (58, 59), (59, 60), (60, 61), (61, 62), (62, 63), (63, 64), (64, 65), (65, 66), (66, 67), (67, 68), (68, 69), (69, 70), (70, 71), (71, 72), (72, 73), (73, 74)].
```

From this edge list, we can calculate the degree of each node. The highest degree is 2, which occurs for nodes 0 and 74 (both are connected to two other nodes).
