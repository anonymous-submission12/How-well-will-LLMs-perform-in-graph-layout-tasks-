To compute the highest degree of all nodes in the graph described by the edge list, we'll first determine the degree of each node by counting how many times it appears in the edge list (as part of an edge). Then, we'll identify the maximum degree from all nodes.

Here is the result:

}
```

Explanation:
- Node `0` is connected to nodes `1` and `70`, so its degree is `2`.
- Node `70` is connected to nodes `0` and `69`, so its degree is `2`.
- All other nodes (from `1` to `69`, excluding `0` and `70`) are part of exactly two edges (one with the previous node and one with the next node), except for `1` which connects to 0 `70 but
