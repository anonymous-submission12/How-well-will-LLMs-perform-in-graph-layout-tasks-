To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we count how many edges are connected to each node.

From the given edge list, node 0 connects to two nodes (1 and 72). Similarly, node 72 connects to two nodes (0 and 71). All other nodes (from 1 to 71) connect to exactly two neighboring nodes.

Thus, the highest degree in the graph is **2**.

Here is the JSON result:
