To count the number of unique nodes in the given graph, we need to extract all unique node numbers from the edge list.

Here's the count of nodes based on the provided data:

- The edge list represents pairs of connected nodes, like `(0, 1)`, `(0, 78)` and so on.
- By collecting all unique node numbers across the pairs, we can determine the total count of nodes.

The unique nodes in the graph are integers ranging from `0` to `78`. Therefore, the number of unique nodes is `79`.

Here's the result in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "answer": 79
}
