To calculate the shortest path length between node '6' and node '57', we observe the graph structure provided in the edge list format. The graph appears to be a linear sequence of nodes. Therefore, the shortest path distance is equivalent to the difference in numerical indices of the two nodes.

Node '6' is connected to node '5' and '7'; similarly, node '57' is connected to node '56' and '58'. Since this is a linear graph, the shortest path length is just the number of edges between nodes '6' and '57', calculated as `57 - 6 = 51`.
