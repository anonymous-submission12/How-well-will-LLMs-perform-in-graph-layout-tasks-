To calculate the shortest path between nodes `49` and `25` in the given graph, we can observe that the graph is a linear chain of nodes. The shortest path between two nodes in such a graph is simply the absolute difference between their indices.

Here, the shortest path length is:

\[
\text{Shortest Path Length} = |49 - 25| = 24
\]

Here is the JSON response:
