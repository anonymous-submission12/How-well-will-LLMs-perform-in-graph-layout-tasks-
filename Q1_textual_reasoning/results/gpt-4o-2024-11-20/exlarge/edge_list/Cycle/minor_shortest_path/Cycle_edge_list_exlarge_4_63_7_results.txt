To calculate the shortest path between nodes `63` and `7` in the given graph, we first note that the graph is represented as an edge list and is essentially a linear path plus a direct edge connecting nodes `0` and `73`.

The shortest path between nodes `63` and `7` is the number of edges that connect them along the linear path.

### Steps:
1. Start from node `63` and count the edges back to node `7`.
2. Subtract `7` from `63` to get the number of edges between them (inclusive).

### Calculation:
The shortest path between `63` and `7` is `63 - 7 = 56`.

### Result:
