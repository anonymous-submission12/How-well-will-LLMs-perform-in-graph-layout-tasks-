To calculate the length of the shortest path between nodes '75' and '54', we observe the graph provided, which forms a chain-like structure. Each edge connects consecutive nodes. The graph is essentially a single path.

Thus, the shortest path between two nodes in this structure corresponds to the count of edges between those nodes. 

Here, the path is from node `75` to `54`. Counting backward from `75` to `54`, we find that there are exactly `21` edges between these two nodes.
