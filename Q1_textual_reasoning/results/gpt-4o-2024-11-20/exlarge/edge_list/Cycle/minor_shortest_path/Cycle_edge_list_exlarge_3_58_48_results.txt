To calculate the shortest path length between node '58' and node '48', we can count the number of edges connecting the two nodes directly in the given graph description. It is clear from the edge list provided that the graph is sequentially structured as a single path. The shortest path traverses backwards from '58' to '48', and the path consists of the edges connecting these nodes.

The difference in values between '58' and '48' is \(58 - 48 = 10\).

Thus, the shortest path length is 10.
