To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '68' and '17' in the given graph, we observe that the graph is structured as a series of sequential nodes connected linearly, forming a simple path. Among these nodes, the shortest path distance can be calculated as the absolute difference in their indices along this path.

Here's the calculation:
- The index of node '68' is 68.
- The index of node '17' is 17.
- The shortest path length = |68 - 17| = 51.

Here is the JSON representation of the answer:
