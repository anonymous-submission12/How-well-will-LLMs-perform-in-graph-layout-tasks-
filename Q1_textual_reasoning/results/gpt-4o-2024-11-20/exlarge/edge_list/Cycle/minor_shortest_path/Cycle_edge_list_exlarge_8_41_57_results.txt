To calculate the shortest path between node '41' and '57', we can observe that the graph is a simple linear chain. The shortest path is the number of edges between the two nodes, which is the absolute difference between their indices.

Node '41' and node '57' are connected directly in the chain, and the shortest path length is:

\[
\text{Shortest path length} = |57 - 41| = 16
\]
