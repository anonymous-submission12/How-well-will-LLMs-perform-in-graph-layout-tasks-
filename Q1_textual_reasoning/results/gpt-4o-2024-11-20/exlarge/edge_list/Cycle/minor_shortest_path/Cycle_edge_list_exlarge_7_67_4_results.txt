To calculate the length of the shortest path between nodes 67 and 4 in the graph represented by the edge list, we'll find that the edges form a path-like structure. Nodes 67 and 4 are connected linearly in this structure, so we can simply count the number of edges between them.

The edges between nodes 4 and 67 in the graph are:  
4 → 5 → 6 → ... → 66 → 67  

The total number of edges is:  
67 - 4 = 63 edges

Here is the JSON response:
