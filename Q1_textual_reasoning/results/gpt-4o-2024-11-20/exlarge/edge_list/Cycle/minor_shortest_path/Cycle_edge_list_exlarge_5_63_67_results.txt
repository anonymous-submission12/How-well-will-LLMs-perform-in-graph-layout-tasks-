To calculate the shortest path between nodes `63` and `67`, we can observe that the graph is a linear chain of nodes. The shortest path between two nodes in such a graph is simply the difference in their indices.

The path from `63` to `67` includes the nodes `63 -> 64 -> 65 -> 66 -> 67`, which is a total of 4 edges.
