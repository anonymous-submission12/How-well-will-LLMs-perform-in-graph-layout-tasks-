To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use community detection algorithms such as the Louvain method or modularity-based approaches. Here's the requested JSON format with the number of communities calculated:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

This indicates that the graph contains 4 distinct communities based on its structure.
