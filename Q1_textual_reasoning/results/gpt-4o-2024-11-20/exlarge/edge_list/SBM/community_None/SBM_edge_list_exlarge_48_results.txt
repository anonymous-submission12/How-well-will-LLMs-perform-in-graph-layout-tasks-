To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use community detection algorithms such as the Louvain method or modularity-based approaches. These algorithms identify clusters of nodes that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to other clusters.

Based on the provided edge list, the graph has a clear community structure. After analyzing the graph, the number of communities is **3**.
