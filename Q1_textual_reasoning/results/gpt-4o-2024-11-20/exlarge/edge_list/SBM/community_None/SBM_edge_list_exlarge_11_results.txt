To determine the number of communities in the graph, we need to apply a community detection algorithm to identify clusters within the graph. Let's process the graph data and compute the number of communities.

We'll use a method like the "connected components" approach for unweighted graphs, as the edge_list provided represents an unweighted graph. Here's the analysis wrapped in JSON:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

There are 4 communities detected in the graph. If you need further details or wish to run advanced community detection algorithms such as "Louvain" or "Girvan-Newman," feel free to specify!
