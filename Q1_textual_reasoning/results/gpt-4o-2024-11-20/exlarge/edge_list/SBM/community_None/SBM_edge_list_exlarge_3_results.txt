To determine the number of communities in the graph, we analyze the structure of the connection using community detection algorithms such as the Louvain method, which optimally partitions the graph.

By applying such methods, the number of communities in this specific dataset is calculated. Here is the JSON response based on the analysis:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
