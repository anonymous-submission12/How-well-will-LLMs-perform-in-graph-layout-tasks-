To calculate the number of communities in the graph, we can employ community detection algorithms such as the Girvan-Newman algorithm, the Louvain method, or others commonly used in graph analysis. Here, I'll find the communities and count how many there are.

After analyzing the graph structure provided, the graph can be partitioned into **3 communities** based on its structural connectivity.
