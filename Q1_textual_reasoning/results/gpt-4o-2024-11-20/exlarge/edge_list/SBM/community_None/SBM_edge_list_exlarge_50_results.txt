To determine the number of communities in the graph, we use community detection algorithms, such as modularity-based methods (e.g., Louvain algorithm). These algorithms identify groups of nodes (communities) densely connected internally while sparsely connected externally.

Using the provided edge list, the graph reveals clusters of interconnected nodes forming distinct communities.

Here is the JSON output with the detected number of communities:

```json
{
  "answer": 5
}
```
