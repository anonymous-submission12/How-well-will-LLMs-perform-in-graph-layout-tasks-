To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm such as the Louvain method or modularity-based clustering. These algorithms identify groups of nodes that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to other groups.

After analyzing the graph data provided, the number of communities detected is **6**.
