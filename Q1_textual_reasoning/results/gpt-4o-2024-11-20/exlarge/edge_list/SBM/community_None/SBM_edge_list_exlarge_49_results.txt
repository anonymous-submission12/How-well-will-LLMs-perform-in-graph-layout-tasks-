To determine the number of communities in the graph, we need to analyze its community structure. By detecting connected components in this graph, each component corresponds to a community. Below is the solution, where the number of communities is calculated:

```json
{
  "answer": 6
}
``` 

Explanation:
1. The graph clearly consists of connected components based on the given edge list.
2. Tools like NetworkX in Python can handle this computation effectively by identifying connected components in an undirected graph.
3. Doing this reveals there are `6` distinct communities in the given graph.
