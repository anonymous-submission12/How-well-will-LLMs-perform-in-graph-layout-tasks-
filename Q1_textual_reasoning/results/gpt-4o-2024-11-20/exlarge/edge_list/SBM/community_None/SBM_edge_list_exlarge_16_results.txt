To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use community detection algorithms such as the Louvain method or modularity-based approaches. These algorithms identify clusters of nodes that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to other clusters.

Based on the provided edge list, the graph appears to have distinct clusters. After analyzing the structure, the graph contains **3 communities**.
