To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use community detection algorithms such as the Louvain method or Girvan-Newman algorithm. These algorithms identify clusters or communities within the graph based on its structure.

Here is the JSON response with the number of communities:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
``` 

This result is based on analyzing the graph's structure and identifying distinct communities.
