To determine the number of communities in the graph, we first analyze its structure using community detection algorithms such as the Louvain method or Girvan-Newman algorithm. Based on the provided edge list data structure, I will process and calculate the total number of communities.

### Solution:

The graph provided appears to have distinctly separate communities. Upon inspecting the edge list, we can notice it divides into two major connected components:

1. Nodes 0-36 form one densely connected community.
2. Nodes 37-73 form another densely connected community.

Thus, the graph has **2 communities**.
