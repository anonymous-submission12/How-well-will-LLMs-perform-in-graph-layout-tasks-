To determine the number of communities in a graph with community structure, one can apply community detection algorithms such as the approach from the **NetworkX** library, which often uses modularity-based methods such as Girvan-Newman or the Louvain algorithm.

Here is the response with the answer based on the graph data provided:

```json
{
  "answer": 6
}
``` 

This suggests that the graph contains **6 communities**. If you would like additional details on community membership for each node or an explanation of how the result was derived using algorithms, let me know!
