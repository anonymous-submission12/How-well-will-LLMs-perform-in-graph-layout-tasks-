To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the provided graph, let's first compute the degree of each node. A node's degree is determined by counting how many edges connect to it.

Here is the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 13
}
``` 

The node with the highest degree is node **66**, and its degree is **13**.
