To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, I will determine the degree of each node by counting the number of edges (connections) associated with each node. The degree of a node is essentially the number of neighbors it has in the graph.

Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 24
}
```

Explanation:
- Node `69` has the highest degree in the graph with a degree of 24 (it is connected to 24 other nodes).
