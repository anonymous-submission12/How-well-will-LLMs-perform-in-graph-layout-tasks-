To solve the problem, we need to calculate the degree of each node in the graph. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. We'll iterate through the edge list and count the number of occurrences of each node. Then, we'll determine the maximum node degree from the counts.

Below is the resulting JSON:

```json
{
  "answer": 14
}
```

This means the highest degree of any node in the graph is 14.
