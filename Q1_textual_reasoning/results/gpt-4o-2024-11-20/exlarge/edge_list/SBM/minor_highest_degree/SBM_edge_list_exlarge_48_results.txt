To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node. Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 19
}
```

Explanation:
- We iterate through the provided edge list and count the degree (number of connections) for each node.
- After determining the degree of all nodes, the highest degree is found to be 19 (belonging to node 26).
