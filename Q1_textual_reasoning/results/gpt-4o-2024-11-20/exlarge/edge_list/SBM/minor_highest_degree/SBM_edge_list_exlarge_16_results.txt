To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of edges connected to each node and find the maximum degree. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 21
}
```

Explanation:
- The graph is represented as an edge list.
- Each edge connects two nodes, and we count the occurrences of each node in the edge list to determine its degree.
- After calculating the degree for all nodes, the maximum degree is found to be **21**.
