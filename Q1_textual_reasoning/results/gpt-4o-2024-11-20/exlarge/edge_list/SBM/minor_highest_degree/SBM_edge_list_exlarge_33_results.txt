To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the provided graph, we need to examine each node and count how many edges are incident to it. Below is the computed result wrapped in a JSON response:

```json
{
  "answer": 37
}
``` 

Explanation:
- The node with the highest degree is node 38, which has 37 edges connected to it. This is derived by scanning through the graph and determining the node with the maximum count of incident edges.
