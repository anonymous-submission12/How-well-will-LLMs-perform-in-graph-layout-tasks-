To calculate the highest degree among all nodes in the graph, we'll first determine the degree (number of connections) of each node by iterating over the edge list and counting connections for each node. The node with the highest degree will give us the highest degree value.

Here is the result in the requested format:

```json
{
  "answer": 18
}
``` 

Explanation:
- After processing the given edge list, the node with the highest degree (most connections to other nodes) has a degree of 18.
