To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to count the number of occurrences of each node in the edge list, as this will represent its degree. Then, we find the maximum degree among all nodes.

Here's the solution in JSON format:

```json
{
  "answer": 33
}
```

Explanation: After processing the given edge list, the node with the highest degree has 33 connections. This involves iterating over the connections and counting occurrences for each node.
