To calculate the shortest path between node '40' and node '1', we'll use an approach like Breadth-First Search (BFS) since the graph appears to be unweighted.

Below is the JSON output with the answer:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

Explanation:  
Using BFS, the shortest path from node `40` to node `1` passes through the following nodes: `40 -> 45 -> 5 -> 1`, resulting in a path length of `3`.
