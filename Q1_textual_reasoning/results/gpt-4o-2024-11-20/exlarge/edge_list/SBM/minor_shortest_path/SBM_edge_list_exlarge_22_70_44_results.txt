To calculate the shortest path between node '70' and node '44', we can represent the graph as an adjacency list and use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to determine the shortest path.

Let me perform the computation:

1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is undirected. Its edges will create connections between nodes.
2. **BFS Implementation**: Start from node '70', explore its neighbors, and calculate the shortest path to node '44'.
