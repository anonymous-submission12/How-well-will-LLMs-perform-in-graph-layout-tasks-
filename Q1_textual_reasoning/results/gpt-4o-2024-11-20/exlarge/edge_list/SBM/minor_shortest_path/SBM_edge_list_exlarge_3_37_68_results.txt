To calculate the shortest path between nodes `37` and `68`, the graph data (given as an edge list) must be analyzed using techniques such as breadth-first search (BFS). BFS is particularly suitable for unweighted graphs to find the shortest path based on the number of edges.

Here is the JSON representation of the result:

  "answer": 6
}
