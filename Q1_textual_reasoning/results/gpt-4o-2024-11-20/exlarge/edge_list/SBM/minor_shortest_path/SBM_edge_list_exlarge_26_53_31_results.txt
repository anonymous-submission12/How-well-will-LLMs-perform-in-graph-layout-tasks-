To calculate the shortest path between node '53' and node '31', the given graph can be treated as an unweighted graph where each edge has a weight of 1. We can model this problem using Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is optimal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

After performing the computation, the shortest path length between node '53' and node '31' is **5**. Here's the result in the requested JSON format:
