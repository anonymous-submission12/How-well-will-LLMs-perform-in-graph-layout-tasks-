To calculate the shortest path length between nodes '54' and '65', we can use a graph traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which is represented by the edge list provided.

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
``` 

The length of the shortest path from node '54' to node '65' is **4**. If you'd like to see the detailed steps, let me know!
