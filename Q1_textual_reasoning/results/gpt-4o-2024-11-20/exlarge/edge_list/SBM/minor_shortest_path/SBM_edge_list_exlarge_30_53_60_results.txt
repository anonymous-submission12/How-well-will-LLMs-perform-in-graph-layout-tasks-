To calculate the shortest path between nodes '53' and '60' given an edge list, we'll leverage the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm—commonly used to find the shortest path in unweighted graphs. Here's the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

Explanation: The shortest path from node '53' to node '60' traverses through nodes:

53 → 63 → 60

This path consists of 3 nodes, resulting in a shortest path length of 2 edges.
