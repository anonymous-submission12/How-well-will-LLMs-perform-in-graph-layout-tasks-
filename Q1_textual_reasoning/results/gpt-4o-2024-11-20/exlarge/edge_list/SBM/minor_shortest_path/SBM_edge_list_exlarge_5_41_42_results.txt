To calculate the shortest path length between nodes `41` and `42`, we can employ a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm and traverse through the graph. Here's the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```

Explanation:  
Nodes `41` and `42` are directly connected in the graph as specified in the edge `(41, 42)`. Therefore, the shortest path length between them is `1`.
