To calculate the shortest path between node `3` and node `22`, we can represent the graph as a set of vertices and edges using the given edge list and perform a shortest path search (e.g., using BFS for an unweighted graph).

Here's the solution wrapped in a JSON:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
```

Explanation:
1. Node `3` is directly connected to node `22` via edge `(3, 22)`.
2. Hence, the length of the shortest path between node `3` and node `22` is `2` steps.
