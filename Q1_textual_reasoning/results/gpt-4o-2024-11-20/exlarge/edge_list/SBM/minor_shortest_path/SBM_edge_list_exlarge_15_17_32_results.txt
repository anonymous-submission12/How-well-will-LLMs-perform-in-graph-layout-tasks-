To find the shortest path between nodes `17` and `32`, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) as it is an appropriate algorithm for unweighted graphs. Here is the computation:

1. Start from node `17` and explore all neighbors level by level.
2. Stop when we reach node `32` and return the distance.

I'll now compute the result.
