To solve the problem and calculate the shortest path length between nodes `44` and `62`, we can treat the provided graph as an unweighted graph and use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to compute the shortest path. BFS is ideal because it ensures the shortest path in terms of the number of edges for unweighted graphs.

Here is the JSON representation of the shortest path length:
