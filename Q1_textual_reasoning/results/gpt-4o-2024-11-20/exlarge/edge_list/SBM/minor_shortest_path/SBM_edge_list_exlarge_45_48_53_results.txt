To calculate the shortest path between nodes `48` and `53`, I will interpret the given graph data and implement a shortest-path algorithm (BFS since the graph is unweighted). Below is the JSON output with the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```

Explanation: Nodes `48` and `53` are directly connected in the edge `(48, 53)`, which means the shortest path length is `1`.
