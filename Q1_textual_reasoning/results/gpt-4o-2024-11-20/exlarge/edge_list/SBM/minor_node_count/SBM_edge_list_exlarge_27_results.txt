To calculate the number of distinct nodes in the graph, we need to identify all unique nodes in the edge list. Here's the JSON result:

```json
{
  "answer": 80
}
```

Explanation:
- The edge list contains pairs of nodes, and we extract all unique nodes from these pairs.
- In this graph, there are 80 unique nodes.
