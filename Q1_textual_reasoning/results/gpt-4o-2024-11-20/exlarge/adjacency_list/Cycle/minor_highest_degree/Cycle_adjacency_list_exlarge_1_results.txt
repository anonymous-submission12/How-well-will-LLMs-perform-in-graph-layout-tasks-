To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of connections (edges) each node has and find the maximum among them.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.
- In the given graph, most nodes have a degree of 2 because they are part of a linear chain.
- However, nodes `0` and `70` have a degree of 3 because they are connected to two other nodes in the chain and also to each other, forming a cycle.
- Therefore, the highest degree in the graph is `3`.
