To calculate the highest degree of all nodes, we need to check the size of the neighbor list for each node in the adjacency list. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

Explanation:

- Most nodes in the graph have a degree of 2 since they are connected to two neighbors.
- The nodes 0 and 71 have a degree of 3 because they form connections as part of a cycle (connected to two neighbors and each other). Hence, the maximum degree is 3.
