To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of connections (edges) each node has and find the maximum among them.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
- The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.
- In the given adjacency list, most nodes have a degree of 2 (connected to two other nodes).
- However, nodes `0` and `78` have a degree of 3 because they are connected to two other nodes and also to each other. Thus, the highest degree in the graph is `3`.
