To find the highest degree of all nodes in the given graph, we calculate the degree of each node by counting its neighbors. Here’s how it goes:

Each node's degree is the length of its adjacency list (number of direct connections). Based on the adjacency list provided:

- Node `0` connects to `[1, 75]`, so its degree is 2.
- Node `75` also connects to `[0, 74]`, so its degree is 2.
- Nodes `1` to `74` generally connect to two neighbors each, except no special cases change their degree.

Thus, the highest degree in this graph is `2`.
