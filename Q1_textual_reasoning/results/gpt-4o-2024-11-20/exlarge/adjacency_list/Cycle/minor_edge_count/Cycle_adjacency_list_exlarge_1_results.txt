To count the number of edges in the graph, we can iterate through the adjacency list and count all the connections. Since the graph is undirected, each edge is represented twice in the adjacency list (once for each vertex it connects). Therefore, the total number of edges is half the total count of connections in the adjacency list.

Here is the calculation:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists.
2. Divide the total by 2 to account for double counting.

### Calculation:
- Total connections: \(2 \times 70 = 140\) (each edge is counted twice).
- Number of edges: \(140 / 2 = 70\).
