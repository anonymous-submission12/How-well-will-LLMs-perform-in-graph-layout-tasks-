To count the number of edges in the graph, we first calculate the total number of connections (i.e., the sum of the lengths of adjacency lists for all nodes), which gives us twice the total number of edges (since each edge is listed twice in an undirected graph). We then divide this total by 2.

The adjacency list provided represents a circular graph, which imposes no unique constraints on the calculation.

Here is the computed result:
