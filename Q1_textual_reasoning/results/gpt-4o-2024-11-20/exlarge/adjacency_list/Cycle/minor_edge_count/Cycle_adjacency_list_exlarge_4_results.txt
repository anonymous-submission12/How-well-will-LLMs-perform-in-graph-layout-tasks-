To count the number of edges in the graph, we can sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide the total by 2 (since each edge is counted twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists:
   - Each node has 2 neighbors, except for node 0 and node 73, which have 2 neighbors each as well (due to the cycle).

2. Total sum of adjacency list lengths = 2 * 74 = 148.

3. Divide by 2 to get the number of unique edges:
   - Number of edges = 148 / 2 = 74.

Thus, the graph has 74 edges.
