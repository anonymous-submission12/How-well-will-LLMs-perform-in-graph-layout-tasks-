To count the number of edges in the graph, we note that the adjacency list represents each edge twice (once for each vertex it connects). Therefore, we sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide by 2 to get the total number of edges.

Here is the calculation:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists:
   - Each vertex has 2 neighbors, except for vertex 0 and vertex 74, which also have 2 neighbors due to the cycle.

2. Total sum of adjacency list lengths = 2 * 75 = 150.

3. Divide by 2 to get the number of edges:
   - Total edges = 150 / 2 = 75.
