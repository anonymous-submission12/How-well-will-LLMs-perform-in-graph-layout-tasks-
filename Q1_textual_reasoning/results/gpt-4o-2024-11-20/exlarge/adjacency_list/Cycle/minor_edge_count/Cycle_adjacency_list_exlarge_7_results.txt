To count the number of edges in the graph, we can sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide by 2 (since each edge is counted twice in an undirected graph). Here's the calculation:

1. Sum of all adjacency list lengths:  
   \( 2 + 2 + 2 + \ldots + 2 = 154 \) (since there are 77 nodes, each with 2 neighbors).

2. Divide by 2 to account for double counting:  
   \( 154 / 2 = 77 \).

Thus, the graph has 77 edges.
