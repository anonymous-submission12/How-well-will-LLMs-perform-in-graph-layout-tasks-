To count the number of edges in the graph, we proceed as follows:

1. In an undirected graph represented as an adjacency list, each edge is listed twice (once for each direction).
2. Thus, we count all entries in the adjacency list (the total number of connections) and divide by 2 to get the total number of unique edges.

### Calculation:
- Number of entries in the adjacency list:
  For each node, we count its neighbors:
  ```
  Total connections = Sum of lengths of adjacency lists = 2 for each node (except the start node & end node which each connect back to a cycle=154
  Total connections -> count ansers ...
```
