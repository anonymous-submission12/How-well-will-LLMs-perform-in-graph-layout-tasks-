To count the number of edges in the graph, we need to consider that the graph data is represented as an adjacency list. In an adjacency list, edges are listed twice: once for each vertex involved in the edge. Therefore, we need to divide the total count of connections by 2 to get the correct number of edges in the graph.

Hereâ€™s the code and methodology to calculate it:

1. Iterate through the adjacency list.
2. Count the total connections.
3. Divide the count by 2 to account for double counting.

Now, calculating for the given graph:
