To calculate the shortest path between node `48` and node `1` in the given graph represented in adjacency list format, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 48
}
```

### Explanation:
1. The graph is a linear representation of nodes connected in sequence, with an additional edge connecting nodes `0` and `71`.
2. Starting at node `48`, BFS proceeds sequentially until it reaches node `1`.
3. Since the nodes are connected sequentially, the shortest path between `48` and `1` is simply the difference in their indices, i.e., `48 - 1 = 48`.
