To calculate the shortest path between node '45' and '64' in the given graph, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS works well for unweighted graphs to find the shortest path distance.

Here is the calculation:

The graph is essentially a sequence of nodes connected in a cycle. Node '45' connects to nodes '44' and '46', and node '64' connects to nodes '63' and '65'. By BFS traversal on this graph, the shortest path from node '45' to '64' can be determined.

Starting from node '45', we traverse to node '64', moving sequentially through the linear connections. Since nodes are sequentially connected, the shortest path distance between '45' and '64' is simply the number of steps from '45' to '64'.

Performing the calculation:
- The direct path from node '45' to '64' is through the sequence `45 -> 46 -> 47 -> ... -> 64`.
- Length = 64 - 45 = 19.

Thus, the shortest path distance is 19.
