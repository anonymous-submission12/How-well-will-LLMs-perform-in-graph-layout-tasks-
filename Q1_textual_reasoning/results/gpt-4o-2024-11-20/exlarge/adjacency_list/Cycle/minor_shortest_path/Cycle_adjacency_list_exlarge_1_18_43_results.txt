To solve this, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is well-suited to finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

### Steps using BFS:
1. Start from node `18`.
2. Traverse the graph level by level until we reach node `43`.
3. Count the shortest distance by maintaining a level tracker.

### Execution:

Below is the JSON representation of the shortest path result after applying BFS.
