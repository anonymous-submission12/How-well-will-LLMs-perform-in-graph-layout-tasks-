To calculate the shortest path between nodes '22' and '65', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. This algorithm is optimal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Using the adjacency list provided, we determine the shortest path.

The length of the shortest path between node '22' and '65' is **43**. Below is the JSON representation of the result:
