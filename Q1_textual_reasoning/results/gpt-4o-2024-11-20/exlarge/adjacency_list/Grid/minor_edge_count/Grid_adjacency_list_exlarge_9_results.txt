To count the number of edges in the graph, note that in the adjacency list representation, each edge is represented twice (once for each of its endpoints). Therefore, we can sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and then divide this sum by 2 to get the total number of edges.

Below is the calculation:

### Step 1
Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists in the given dictionary:
```python
graph = {0: [1, 37], ..., 73: [36, 72]}  # (complete graph data)

total_degrees = sum(len(neighbors) for neighbors in graph.values())  # This gives the total representation count of edges
```

### Step 2
Divide `total_degrees` by 2 to get the number of edges, as each edge is counted twice.

### Result
The total edge count is:
