To compute the number of edges in the graph, note that each edge is represented twice in the adjacency list (once for each of its endpoints). By summing the lengths of all adjacency lists and dividing by 2, we get the total number of edges.

Hereâ€™s the calculation:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists.
2. Divide the sum by 2 to account for duplicates.

### Calculation:
Each node in the adjacency list contributes to the count of edges. The sum of the lengths of all adjacency lists is:

```plaintext
Sum = (2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2
      + 2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 2)
      = 154
```

Total number of edges = 154 / 2 = 77.
