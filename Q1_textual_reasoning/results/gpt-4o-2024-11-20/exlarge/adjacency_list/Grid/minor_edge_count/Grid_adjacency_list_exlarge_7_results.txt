To calculate the number of edges in the graph, we can use the adjacency list representation provided. Each key in the adjacency list has a list of its neighboring nodes. If we sum up the lengths of all these lists, we get twice the number of edges in the graph (since each edge is counted twice, once for each of its two vertices). We then divide this sum by 2 to get the actual number of edges.

Here is the result:
