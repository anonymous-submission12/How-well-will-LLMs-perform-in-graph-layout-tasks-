To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of connections (edges) for each node and find the maximum value.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

Explanation:
- The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.
- In the given adjacency list, nodes such as `17`, `18`, `19`, etc., have 4 connections, which is the highest degree in the graph.
