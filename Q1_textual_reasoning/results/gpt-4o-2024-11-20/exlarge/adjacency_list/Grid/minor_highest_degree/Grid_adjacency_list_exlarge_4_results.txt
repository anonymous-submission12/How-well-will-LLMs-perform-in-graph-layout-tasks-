To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, follow these steps:
1. The degree of a node is defined as the number of neighbors it is connected to.
2. Iterate through the adjacency list to calculate the degree of each node.
3. Identify the maximum degree among all nodes.

Here's the result in JSON format:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

Explanation:
- Most nodes in the graph have either 2, 3, or 4 connections.
- The highest degree is **4**, as some nodes (like node 27) are connected to 4 neighbors.
