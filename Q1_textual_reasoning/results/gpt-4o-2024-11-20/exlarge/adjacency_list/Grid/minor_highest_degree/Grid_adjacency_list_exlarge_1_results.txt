To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of connections (edges) each node has and find the maximum among them. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

Explanation:
- The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.
- In the given adjacency list, nodes like `26`, `27`, ..., `48` have the highest degree of `4` because they are connected to four other nodes.
