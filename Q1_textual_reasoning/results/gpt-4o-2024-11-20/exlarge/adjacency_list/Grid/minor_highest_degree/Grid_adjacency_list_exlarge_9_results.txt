To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the provided graph, we determine the maximum number of connections (edges) any node has. The degree of a node is the length of its adjacency list.

Hereâ€™s the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

Explanation:  
The maximum degree in the graph is 3, where multiple nodes (like 38, 39, etc.) have 3 connections. Most of the graph follows this pattern of max degree.
