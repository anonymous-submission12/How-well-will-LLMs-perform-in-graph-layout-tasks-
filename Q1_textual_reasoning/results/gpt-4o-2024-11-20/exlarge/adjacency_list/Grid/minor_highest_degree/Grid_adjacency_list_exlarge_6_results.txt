To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the provided graph, I will find the node with the maximum number of neighbors (degree). The degree of a node is equal to the length of the list of its neighbors in the adjacency list.

Here's the calculated result encapsulated in a JSON object:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

The highest degree is **3**, which occurs for multiple nodes.
