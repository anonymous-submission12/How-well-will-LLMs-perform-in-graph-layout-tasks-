To calculate the shortest path between nodes `45` and `6`, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 25
}
```

Explanation:
- Using BFS, we start from node `45` and explore its neighbors, then their neighbors, and so on, until we reach node `6`.
- The shortest path length between node `45` and node `6` is `25`.
