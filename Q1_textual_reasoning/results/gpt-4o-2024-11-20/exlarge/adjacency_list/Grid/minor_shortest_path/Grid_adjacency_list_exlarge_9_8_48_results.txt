To calculate the shortest path length between nodes '8' and '48', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which efficiently computes the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the calculation:

1. Start BFS from node '8'.
2. Visit neighbors level by level until node '48' is reached.
3. Count the levels traversed to reach node '48'.

Let's compute this:

{
  "answer": 40
}
