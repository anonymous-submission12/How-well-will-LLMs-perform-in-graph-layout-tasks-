To calculate the shortest path between node `8` and node `40`, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm since the graph is unweighted. BFS finds the shortest path in terms of the number of edges between two nodes in such a graph.

Here is the calculation:

- Start at node `8`.
- Explore neighbors level by level until node `40` is found.

Using BFS, the length of the shortest path between node `8` and node `40` is determined to be `8`.
