To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we determine the number of edges connected to each node (its degree) and find the maximum value.

Given the adjacency list format provided, each key corresponds to a node, and its list value corresponds to the nodes it's connected to. The degree of a node is the length of its adjacency list.

Here is the solution:

### Solution:

{
  "answer": 2
}
```

### Explanation:
In this graph, each node connects to at most two other nodes (for example, `1` connects to `0` and `2`), making it a line graph. Therefore, the maximum degree of any node in this graph is `2`.
