To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph represented as an adjacency list, we simply need to find the maximum length of the adjacency list for any node (indicating the number of neighbors connected to that node).

Given the provided adjacency list, all intermediate nodes (those not at the ends of the chain) have exactly 2 neighbors, while the nodes at the very ends (0 and 71) each have only 1 neighbor. Hence, the highest degree for this graph is **2**.

Here is the result in JSON format:
