To calculate the number of edges in the graph provided in the adjacency list format, we count the connections (edges) for each node and divide by 2. This is because each edge is represented twice in the adjacency listâ€”once from the perspective of each node it connects.

### Step-by-step:
1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists.
2. Divide the sum by 2 to account for the duplication.

Now, let's compute this:
