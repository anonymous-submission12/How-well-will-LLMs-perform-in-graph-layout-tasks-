To count the number of edges in the graph, we can use the adjacency list provided. Each edge is represented twiceâ€”once in each of the two vertices it connects. To avoid double-counting, the total number of connections in the adjacency list is divided by 2.

Here's the calculation:

1. Count the total number of connections in the adjacency list.
2. Divide the total count by 2 to find the number of unique edges.

Now, let's compute that:

- Sum of lengths of all adjacency lists (connections):  
  \( \sum_{i=0}^{71} \text{len}(adjacency_list[i]) = 2 + 2 + 2 + \ldots + 2 = 142 \)
  (Each vertex has exactly 2 connections except the first and last, which have 1 connection.)

- Number of edges:  
  \( \text{Number of edges} = \frac{\text{Total connections}}{2} = \frac{142}{2} = 71 \)
