To count the number of edges in the graph, we can iterate through the adjacency list and count all connections. Since each edge is represented twice (once for each vertex it connects), we divide the total count by 2 to get the actual number of edges.

Here is the calculation:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists.
2. Divide the total by 2 to account for double counting.

### Calculation:
- The adjacency list provided represents a linear graph where each node (except the first and last) is connected to two other nodes.
- Summing the lengths of all adjacency lists:
  - Node 0 has 1 connection.
  - Nodes 1 through 69 each have 2 connections.
  - Node 70 has 1 connection.

Total connections = \(1 + (69 \times 2) + 1 = 141\).

Since each edge is counted twice, the number of edges is:
\[
\text{Number of edges} = \frac{141}{2} = 70
\]
