To determine the number of edges in the graph, we count the total number of connections in the adjacency list and then divide by 2 (since each edge is represented twice: once for each endpoint).

Here is the solution:

1. Count all occurrences of neighbors in the adjacency list.
2. Divide the total count by 2 (to avoid double counting).

Below is the result:
