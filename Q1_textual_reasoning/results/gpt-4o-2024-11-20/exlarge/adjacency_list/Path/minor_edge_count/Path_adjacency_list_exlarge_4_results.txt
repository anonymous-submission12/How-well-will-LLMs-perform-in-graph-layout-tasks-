To determine the number of edges in the graph, note that the graph is represented as an adjacency list. Each edge is listed twice (once for each connected node). Therefore, we count all entries in the adjacency list and divide the total count by 2.

Here is the calculation:

1. Count the total number of entries in the adjacency list.
2. Divide the total by 2 to get the number of unique edges.

Now, based on the provided adjacency list:

- The adjacency list contains node connections for 74 nodes (from 0 to 73).
- Each node (except the first and last) connects to two neighbors, and the first (node 0) and last (node 73) connect to one neighbor each.
- The total count of adjacency list entries is \(2 \times 72 + 1 + 1 = 146\).
- The number of unique edges is \(146 / 2 = 73\).

So, the graph has **73 edges**.
