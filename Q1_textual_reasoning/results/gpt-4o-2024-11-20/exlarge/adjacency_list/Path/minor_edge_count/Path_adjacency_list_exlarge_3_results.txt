To calculate the number of edges in the given graph represented as an adjacency list, we note the following:

- The adjacency list provides connections for each node in both directions (e.g., if `0` connects to `1`, then `1` connects to `0`).
- Therefore, each edge is counted twice in the adjacency list. To determine the actual number of edges, we need to sum up the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide by 2.

Here is the solution:
