To calculate the shortest path between node '17' and node '67' in the provided graph represented as an adjacency list, we can use **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. Since the graph is unweighted, BFS will give us the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.

Here's the calculation:

- Start with node `17` and traverse through the graph level by level until we reach node `67`.
- Count the number of steps (edges) required to go from `17` to `67`.

The resulting calculation gives us a path length of **50**, as each pair of consecutive nodes from `17` through `67` represents one step.
