To calculate the shortest path between node '43' and '63', we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Since the graph is represented as an adjacency list and appears to be a linear graph, the shortest path is simply the difference between the two node indices.

The shortest path length between node '43' and '63' is:
