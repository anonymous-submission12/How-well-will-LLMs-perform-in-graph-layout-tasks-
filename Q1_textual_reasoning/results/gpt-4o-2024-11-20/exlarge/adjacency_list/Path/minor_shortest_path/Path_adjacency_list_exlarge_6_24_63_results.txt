To solve for the shortest path length between nodes '24' and '63' in the given graph, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. This algorithm is well-suited for unweighted graphs like the one provided.

### Analysis
This graph is essentially linear, with each node connected to at most two neighbors, forming a chain-like structure. The shortest path in such graphs is the number of edges between the two nodes.

### Implementation and Result:
Using BFS, we calculate the shortest path between node '24' and node '63' as follows:

```json
{
  "answer": 39
}
```

### Explanation:
Starting from node '24' and traversing sequentially through the nodes to reach node '63', we count 39 edges in this linear graph.
