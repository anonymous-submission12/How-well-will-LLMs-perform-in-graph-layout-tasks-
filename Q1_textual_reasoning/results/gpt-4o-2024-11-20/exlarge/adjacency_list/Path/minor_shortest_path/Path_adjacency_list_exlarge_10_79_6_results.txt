The graph provided is a linear (unweighted and connected) graph. To compute the shortest path between nodes '79' and '6', we can use a simple Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.

In this graph representation, the shortest path between two nodes is the number of edges between them. As the graph is linear, we can determine the shortest path by calculating the distance directly along the path.

### Distance Calculation:
Node '79' and node '6' have indices in a sequence from 0 to 79. The shortest path between them is calculated as the absolute difference of their indices:
\[
\text{Distance} = |79 - 6| = 73
\]

### Final JSON Result:
