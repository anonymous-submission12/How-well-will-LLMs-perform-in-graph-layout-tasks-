To calculate the shortest path between nodes `40` and `60`, let's analyze the structure of the provided graph:

The graph is represented as an adjacency list. Node `0` is connected to all other nodes (`1` through `76`), and all other nodes are only connected back to node `0`. This makes node `0` the central hub of the graph.

Thus, the shortest path between node `40` and node `60` must pass through node `0`. The path will be:
1. `40` → `0`
2. `0` → `60`

The shortest path length is `2`.
