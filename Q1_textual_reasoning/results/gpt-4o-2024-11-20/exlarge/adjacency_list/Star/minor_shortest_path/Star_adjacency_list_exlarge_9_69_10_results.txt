To determine the shortest path between node `'69'` and `'10'`, let's analyze the graph given. From the adjacency list, it can be observed that node `'0'` is directly connected to all other nodes in the graph, making this graph a star topology.

In a star topology:
- The shortest path between any two leaf nodes (such as `69` and `10`) is always `2`, as it requires passing through the central node `'0'`.

Hence, the shortest path length between node `'69'` and `'10'` is `2`.
