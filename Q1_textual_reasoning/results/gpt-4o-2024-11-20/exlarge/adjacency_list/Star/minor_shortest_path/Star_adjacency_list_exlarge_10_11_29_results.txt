To calculate the shortest path between node '11' and node '29', we can observe the graph structure. The graph is a star graph where node '0' is the central node connected to all other nodes. Therefore, the shortest path between any two nodes (e.g., '11' and '29') is through node '0'.

The shortest path from '11' to '29' is:
- From '11' to '0' (1 step)
- From '0' to '29' (1 step)

Thus, the total length of the shortest path is 2.
