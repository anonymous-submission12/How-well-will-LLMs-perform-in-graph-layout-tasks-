To solve the problem, we notice that this graph represents a star topology, where node '0' is the central hub connected to all other nodes, and no other connections exist. The shortest path between any two non-central nodes (e.g., '73' and '2') must therefore go through node '0'.

Steps to calculate the shortest path between '73' and '2':
1. From '73' to '0': 1 edge.
2. From '0' to '2': 1 edge.
3. Total length = 1 + 1 = 2.
