To find the shortest path between node `'54'` and `'35'`, the graph given describes a star topology where all nodes are directly connected to the central node `'0'`. Using Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a straightforward method to calculate this in such a graph.

Here, both node `'54'` and `'35'` are directly connected to node `'0'`, so:

1. From `'54'` to `'0'`, the distance is `1`.
2. From `'0'` to `'35'`, the distance is `1`.

Thus, the total shortest path distance between `'54'` and `'35'` is `2`.
