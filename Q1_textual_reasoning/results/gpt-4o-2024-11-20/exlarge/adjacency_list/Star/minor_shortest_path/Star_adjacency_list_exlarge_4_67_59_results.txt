To calculate the length of the shortest path between node `67` and `59`, we can examine the graph's structure. The graph is in the format of an adjacency list, and from the data, we see that all nodes except node `0` are directly connected only to node `0`.

Hence, to travel from `67` to `59`, the path goes from `67` to `0`, then from `0` to `59`. This requires two steps, as both `67` → `0` and `0` → `59` are direct edges.

The shortest path length is `2`.
