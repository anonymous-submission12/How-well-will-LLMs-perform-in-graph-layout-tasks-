The graph is structured such that node `0` is connected to all other nodes, and all other nodes are only connected to node `0`. This is essentially a "star graph". Therefore, the shortest path between any two non-central nodes always goes through the central node `0`.

For the shortest path between node `27` and node `18`:
1. `27 -> 0` (1 step).
2. `0 -> 18` (1 step).

Thus, the shortest path contains 2 steps.
