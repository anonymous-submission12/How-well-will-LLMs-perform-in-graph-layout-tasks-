To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the given adjacency list, we count the number of connections (edges) for each node and determine the maximum.

In this case:
- Node 0 has connections to 74 other nodes, giving it a degree of 74.
- All other nodes (1 through 74) are only connected to node 0, giving each of them a degree of 1.  

Thus, the highest degree in the graph is **74**.

Here is the JSON response:
