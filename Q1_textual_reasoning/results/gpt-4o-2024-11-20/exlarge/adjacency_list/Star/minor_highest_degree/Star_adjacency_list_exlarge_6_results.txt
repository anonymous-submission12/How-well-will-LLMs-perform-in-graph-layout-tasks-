To find the highest degree of all nodes in the given graph, we compute the degree of each node by counting the number of adjacent nodes in the adjacency list provided. Here's the output:

```json
{
  "answer": 75
}
``` 

This is because node `0` has 75 connections, which is the maximum degree among all nodes.
