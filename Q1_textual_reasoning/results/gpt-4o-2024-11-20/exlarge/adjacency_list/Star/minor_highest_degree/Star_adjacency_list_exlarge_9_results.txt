Here's the calculation:

The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. In the provided graph:

- Node `0` has connections to 78 other nodes, resulting in a degree of `78`.
- All other nodes (from `1` to `78`) only have a single connection to node `0`, resulting in a degree of `1`.

Therefore, the highest degree in the graph is `78`.
