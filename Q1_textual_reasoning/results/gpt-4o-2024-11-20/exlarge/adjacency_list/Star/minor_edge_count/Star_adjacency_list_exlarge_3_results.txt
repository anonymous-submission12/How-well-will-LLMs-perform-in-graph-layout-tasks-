To count the number of edges in the graph represented by the given adjacency list, we can use the following approach:

1. Each adjacency list entry shows the neighbors of a node.
2. Since this is an undirected graph, each edge is counted twice in the adjacency list.
3. We will count all the neighbor relations, and divide the total by 2 to get the actual number of edges.

Here is the calculation:

- Node `0` has 72 neighbors: `[1, 2, 3, ..., 72]`.
- All other nodes (from `1` to `72`) each have only 1 neighbor (`0`).

So the total number of edge references in the graph is:
- Node `0`: 72 references.
- Nodes `1` to `72`: 72 references (1 per node).

Thus, the total number of edge references is `72 + 72 = 144`. Dividing by 2 gives the actual edge count:
- Number of edges = 144 / 2 = 72.

Now, we will format the answer in the required JSON representation.
