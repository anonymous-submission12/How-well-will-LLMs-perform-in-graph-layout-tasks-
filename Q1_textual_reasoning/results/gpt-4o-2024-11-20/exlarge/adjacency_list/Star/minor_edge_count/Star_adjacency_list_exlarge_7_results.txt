To count the number of edges in the graph, we can sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide by 2 (since each edge is represented twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

- Node `0` has 76 neighbors.
- Each of the other 76 nodes has only 1 neighbor (node `0`).

Total edges = (76 + 76) / 2 = 76.
