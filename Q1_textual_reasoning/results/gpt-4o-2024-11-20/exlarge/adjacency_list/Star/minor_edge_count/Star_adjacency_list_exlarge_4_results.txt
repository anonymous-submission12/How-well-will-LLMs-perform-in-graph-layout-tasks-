To count the number of edges in a graph, we sum up the lengths of adjacency lists for all vertices and divide by 2 (since each edge is counted twice in an undirected graph).

Here, the adjacency list is as follows:
- Node `0` has 73 neighbors.
- Each of the nodes `1` through `73` has only `0` as a neighbor.

This means the total count of edges is:

\[ \text{Total edges} = \frac{\text{Sum of all adjacency list lengths}}{2} = \frac{73 + 73}{2} = 73 \]

Thus, there are 73 edges in this graph.

Here's the JSON result:
