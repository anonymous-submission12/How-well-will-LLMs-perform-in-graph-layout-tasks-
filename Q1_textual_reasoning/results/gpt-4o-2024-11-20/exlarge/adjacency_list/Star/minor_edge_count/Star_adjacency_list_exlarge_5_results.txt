The provided adjacency list represents a graph. Each edge is listed twice in the adjacency list: once for each of its two vertices. To obtain the correct number of edges, we count all entries in the adjacency list and divide by 2.

In this graph, vertex `0` has 74 edges (connections to vertices `1` through `74`), and each of these vertices has a single edge back to vertex `0`. Thus, the total number of edges is:

\[
\text{Total edges} = \frac{\text{Sum of all adjacency list lengths}}{2}
\]

The calculation proceeds as follows:
- Vertex `0` has 74 connections.
- Each of the vertices `1` through `74` has exactly 1 connection (to vertex `0`).

Total connections listed in adjacency list:
\[
74 + 74 = 148
\]

Divide by `2` to get the actual number of edges:
\[
\text{Number of edges} = 148 / 2 = 74
\]
