To determine the number of edges in the graph represented in the adjacency list above, we can count the total connections (edges) in the list, ensuring we don't double-count edges for an undirected graph.

Here's the solution:

1. **Count the total connections**: For each node, we count the number of neighbors in its adjacency list.
2. **Divide by 2 for undirected graphs**: Since each edge is listed twice (once for each node in the pair), we divide the total by 2.

For the given adjacency list:
- Node `0` connects to 79 other nodes.
- All other nodes (`1` to `79`) connect back to node `0`.

This gives a total of `79 + 79 = 158` counted edges. Dividing by 2 for undirected graphs, we get **79 edges**.

Here's the JSON output:
