To count the number of edges in an undirected graph represented by an adjacency list, we sum the lengths of all adjacency lists (number of edges for each node). Since the graph is undirected, each edge is counted twice (once from each of its endpoints), so we divide the total by 2.

Here is the calculation for the provided adjacency list:

1. Node `0` has 70 neighbors (edges).
2. Each of the other nodes (from `1` to `70`) has 1 neighbor (edge).

The total raw edge count is:
\[
70 + 1 \times 70 = 140
\]

Since each edge is counted twice in the adjacency list, the total number of unique edges is:
\[
140 / 2 = 70
\]
