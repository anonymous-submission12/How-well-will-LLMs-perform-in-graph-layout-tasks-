To count the number of edges in the graph, we can sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide the total by 2 (since each edge is represented twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

- Node `0` has 77 neighbors.
- All other nodes (`1` to `77`) have only 1 neighbor (node `0`).

The total number of edges is:
\[
\text{Total edges} = \frac{\text{Sum of adjacency list lengths}}{2} = \frac{77 + 1 \times 77}{2} = \frac{154}{2} = 77
\]

Here is the JSON response:
