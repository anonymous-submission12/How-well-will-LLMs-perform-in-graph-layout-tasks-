To count the number of edges in the graph, we can sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide by 2 (since each edge is counted twice in an undirected graph). Here's the calculation:

- Node `0` has 71 neighbors.
- Each of the other 71 nodes has only 1 neighbor (node `0`).

Total edges = (71 + 71) / 2 = 71.
