To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we iterate through the adjacency list and compute the degree of each node by counting the number of neighbors. The highest degree is the maximum of these values.

Here is the resulting JSON:

```json
{
  "answer": 6
}
```

Explanation:
The node with the highest degree has 6 neighbors, as calculated from the given adjacency list.
