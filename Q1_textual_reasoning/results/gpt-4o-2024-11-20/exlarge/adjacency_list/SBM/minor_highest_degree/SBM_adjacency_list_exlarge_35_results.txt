To determine the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we calculate the degree of each node (the length of the corresponding adjacency list for each node) and find the maximum degree.

### Solution
Below is the JSON output:

```json
{
  "answer": 10
}
```

This maximum degree is derived through analyzing
