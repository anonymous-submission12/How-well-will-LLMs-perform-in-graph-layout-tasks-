To solve the problem of finding the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to calculate the degree (number of neighbors) for each node in the adjacency list and determine the maximum degree. Below is the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 11
}
```

Explanation:
The node with the highest degree is `54`, which has `11` neighbors: `[25, 46, 48, 50, 51, 52, 53, 55, 56, 57, 59]`. Thus, the highest degree in the graph is `11`.
