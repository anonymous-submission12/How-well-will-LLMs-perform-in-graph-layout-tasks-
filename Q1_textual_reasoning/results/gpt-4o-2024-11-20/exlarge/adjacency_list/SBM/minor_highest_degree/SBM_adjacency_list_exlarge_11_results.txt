To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we determine the degree of each node by counting the number of neighbors each node has in the adjacency list. The highest degree will be the maximum value among these counts.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 9
}
```

Explanation:
- The node with the highest degree in the graph is node 5, which has 9 neighbors.
