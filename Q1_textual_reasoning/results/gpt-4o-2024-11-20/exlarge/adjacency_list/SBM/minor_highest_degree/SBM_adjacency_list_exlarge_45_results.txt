To calculate the highest degree of nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of neighbors (edges) for each node and identify the maximum degree.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 14
}
```

### Explanation:
The graph data provided is structured as an adjacency list. For each key (node), the associated list contains its neighbors (connected nodes). The degree of a node is simply the count of its neighbors.

Upon iterating through all nodes:
- The node with the highest degree is `53`, which has `14` neighbors. Hence, the highest degree of all nodes in the graph is `14`.
