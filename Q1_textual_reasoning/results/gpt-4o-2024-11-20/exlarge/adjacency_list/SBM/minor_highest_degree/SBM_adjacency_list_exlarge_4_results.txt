To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the number of connections (edges) each node has and find the maximum among them. The degree of a node is the length of its adjacency list.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 9
}
```

Explanation:
- The node with the highest degree is node `22` (or any other node with the same degree), which has 9 connections.
