To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the provided graph, first, we calculate the degree for each node by counting its neighbors. Then, we simply determine the maximum degree.

Here's the resulting JSON:

```json
{
  "answer": 8
}
```

The highest degree in the graph is **8**, and node `15` has this degree.
