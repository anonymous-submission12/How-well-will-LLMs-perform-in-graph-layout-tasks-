To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we need to determine the maximum number of edges connected to each node (degree) from the adjacency list.

Here is the solution:

1. For each node in the adjacency list, calculate its degree by finding the length of its adjacency list.
2. Find the maximum degree among all nodes.

### Calculation

```
Degree of node:
- Node 0: degree = 4
- Node 1: degree = 5
- Node 2: degree = 3
- Node 3: degree = 5
- Node 4: degree = 4
- Node 5: degree = 6
- Node 6: degree = 6
- Node 7: degree = 4
- Node 8: degree = 7
- Node 9: degree = 4
- Node 10: degree = 4
- Node 11: degree = 6
- Node 12: degree = 7
- Node 13: degree = 7
- Node 14: degree = 8
- Node 15: degree = 5
- Node 16: degree = 3
- Node 17: degree = 9
- Node 18: degree = 9
- Node 19: degree = 4
- Node 20: degree = 5
- Node 21: degree = 6
- Node 22: degree = 6
- Node 23: degree = 6
- Node 24: degree = 7
- Node 25: degree = 6
- Node 26: degree = 4
- Node 27: degree = 3
- Node 28: degree = 2
- Node 29: degree = 5
- Node 30: degree = 6
- Node 31: degree = 3
- Node 32: degree = 4
- Node 33: degree = 5
- Node 34: degree = 4
- Node 35: degree = 6
- Node 36: degree = 3
- Node 37: degree = 4
- Node 38: degree = 4
- Node 39: degree = 4
- Node 40: degree = 3
- Node 41: degree = 4
- Node 42: degree = 4
- Node 43: degree = 2
- Node 44: degree = 3
- Node 45: degree = 7
- Node 46: degree = 3
- Node 47: degree = 5
- Node 48: degree = 4
- Node 49: degree = 6
- Node 50: degree = 3
- Node 51: degree = 5
- Node 52: degree = 8
- Node 53: degree = 6
- Node 54: degree = 3
- Node 55: degree = 4
- Node 56: degree = 6
- Node 57: degree = 4
- Node 58: degree = 5
- Node 59: degree = 6
- Node 60: degree = 9
- Node 61: degree = 5
- Node 62: degree = 5
- Node 63: degree = 4
- Node 64: degree = 4
- Node 65: degree = 5
- Node 66: degree = 6
- Node 67: degree = 5
- Node 68: degree = 5
- Node 69: degree = 2
- Node 70: degree = 6
- Node 71: degree = 4
- Node 72: degree = 4
- Node 73: degree = 4
- Node 74: degree = 2
- Node 75: degree = 1
- Node 76: degree = 5
- Node 77: degree = 4
- Node 78: degree = 8
```

### Result

The maximum degree is **9**, which corresponds to nodes 17, 18, and 60.

### Output
```json
{
  "answer": 9
}
```
