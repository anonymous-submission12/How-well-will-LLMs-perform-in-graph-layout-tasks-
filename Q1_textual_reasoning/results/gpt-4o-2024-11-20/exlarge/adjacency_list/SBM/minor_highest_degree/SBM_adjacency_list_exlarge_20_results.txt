To calculate the highest degree of all nodes in the graph, we iterate over each node's adjacency list, compute the degree (number of connections) for each node, and find the maximum. Below is the answer wrapped in JSON format:

```json
{
  "answer": 9
}
```

The highest degree of any node in the graph is 9 (achieved by nodes such as 8, 20, and 69).
