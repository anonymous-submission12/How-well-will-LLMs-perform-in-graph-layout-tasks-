To count the number of edges in the graph represented by the adjacency list provided, you must follow these steps:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists (since each connection is listed for every vertex).
2. Divide the sum by 2 to avoid double-counting edges (an undirected edge is listed twice in the adjacency list).

Here is the solution:

### Code:
```json
{
  "answer": 216
}
