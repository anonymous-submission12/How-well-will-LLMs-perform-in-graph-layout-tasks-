To determine the number of edges in the given graph, we calculate the sum of the lengths of the adjacency lists for all nodes. This sum gives twice the total number of edges because an edge `u-v` is counted once in the adjacency list of `u` and once in the adjacency list of `v`. Dividing this sum by 2 gives the actual number of edges.

Here is the computation:

### Calculation in Steps:

1. **Sum of All Adjacency List Lengths:**  
   - Compute the total number of entries in the adjacency lists.
2. **Divide by 2:**  
   - Since each edge is counted twice, divide by 2 to get the total number of edges.
