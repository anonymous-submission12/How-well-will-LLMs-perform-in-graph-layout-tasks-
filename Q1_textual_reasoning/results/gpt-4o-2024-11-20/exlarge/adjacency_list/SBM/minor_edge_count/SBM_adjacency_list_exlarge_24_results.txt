To count the edges in the graph provided in adjacency list format, we can use the following process:

1. Iterate over each key in the adjacency list.
2. Count the total number of connections listed for each node.
3. Since each edge is counted twice (once for each node it connects), divide the total count by 2 to get the actual number of edges.

Here is the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 367
}
