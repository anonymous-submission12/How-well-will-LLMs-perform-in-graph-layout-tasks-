To count the number of edges in the graph, we need to sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide the total by 2 (since each edge is represented twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists.
2. Divide the total by 2 to account for double counting.
