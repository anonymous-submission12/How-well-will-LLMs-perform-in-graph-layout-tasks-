To calculate the number of edges in the graph:

1. Each key in the adjacency list represents a node.
2. The total count of neighbors for all nodes in the adjacency list gives the sum of degrees of all nodes.
3. Since each edge is counted twice (once for each node), the total number of edges is half the total sum of degrees.

Here is the calculated number of edges:
