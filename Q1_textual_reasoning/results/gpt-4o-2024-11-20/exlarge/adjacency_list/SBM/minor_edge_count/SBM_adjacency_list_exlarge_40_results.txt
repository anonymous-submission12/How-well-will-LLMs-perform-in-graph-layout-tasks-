To calculate the number of edges in the graph described by the adjacency list, we can follow these steps:

1. Iterate through each node and count the edges listed in its adjacency list.
2. Since this is an undirected graph, each edge will be counted twice in the adjacency lists (once for each vertex of the edge). To find the unique number of edges, divide the total count by 2.
