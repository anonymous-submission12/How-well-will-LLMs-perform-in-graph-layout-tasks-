To count the number of edges in the graph represented by the given adjacency list, we can loop through the list and sum the lengths of all neighboring lists. However, because this representation counts each edge twice (once for each node it connects), we divide the total sum by 2.

Let's compute the total number of edges in the graph:

### Steps:
1. Sum up the lengths of all adjacency lists.
2. Divide the sum by 2 to correct for double-counting.

```python
adjacency_list = {
    # Referencing the provided adjacency list from <graph data>
}

# Count edges
total_edges = sum(len(neighbors) for neighbors in adjacency_list.values()) // 2

# Wrap JSON output
result = {"answer": total_edges}
```

Now, using the graph data:

Hereâ€™s the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 519
}
```
