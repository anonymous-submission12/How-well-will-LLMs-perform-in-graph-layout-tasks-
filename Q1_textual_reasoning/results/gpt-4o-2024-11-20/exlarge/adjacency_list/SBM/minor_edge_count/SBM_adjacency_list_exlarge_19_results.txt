To count the number of edges in the graph represented by the adjacency list, follow these steps:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists (each entry in the dictionary).
2. Since this graph representation lists each edge twice (once for each vertex), divide the total sum by 2 to get the actual number of edges.

Finally, here's the result:

  "answer": 422
