To count the number of edges in the graph, we need to sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide the total by 2 (since each edge is represented twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists:
   - `{0: [3, 4, 6, 10]}` has 4 edges.
   - `{1: [3, 7, 11, 12, 59]}` has 5 edges.
   - `{2: [8, 11, 12, 46, 56]}` has 5 edges.
   - `{3: [0, 1, 9]}` has 3 edges.
   - `{4: [0, 7, 9, 10, 12, 63]}` has 6 edges.
   - `{5: [6, 7, 8]}` has 3 edges.
   - `{6: [0, 5, 9, 10]}` has 4 edges.
   - `{7: [1, 4, 5, 8, 12, 57]}` has 6 edges.
   - `{8: [2, 5, 7, 11]}` has 4 edges.
   - `{9: [3, 4, 6, 10, 11]}` has 5 edges.
   - `{10: [0, 4, 6, 9]}` has 4 edges.
   - `{11: [1, 2, 8, 9, 12]}` has 5 edges.
   - `{12: [1, 2, 4, 7, 11]}` has 5 edges.
   - `{13: [14, 18, 22]}` has 3 edges.

2. Total sum of all edges: 376.

3. Divide by 2 to account for double counting: \( \frac{376}{2} = 188 \).
