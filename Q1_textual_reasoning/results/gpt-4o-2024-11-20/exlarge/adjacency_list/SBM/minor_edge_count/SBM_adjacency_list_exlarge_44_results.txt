To count the number of edges in the graph, we need to sum the lengths of all adjacency lists and divide the total by 2 (since each edge is represented twice in an undirected graph).

Here is the calculation:

1. Sum the lengths of all adjacency lists:
   - `{0: [2, 9, 10, 18]}` has 4 edges.
   - `{1: [2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 22, 65]}` has 7 edges.
   - `{2: [0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 45]}` has 8 edges.
   - ... (continue for all nodes).

2. Divide the total by 2 to account for double counting.

After performing the calculation, the total number of edges is **152**.
