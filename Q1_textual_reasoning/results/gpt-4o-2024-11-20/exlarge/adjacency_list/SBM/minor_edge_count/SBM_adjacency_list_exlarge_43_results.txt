To count the number of edges in the graph given in the adjacency list format, we proceed as follows:

1. Count all the entries in the adjacency lists.
2. Since each edge is represented twice (once for each node it connects), divide the total count by 2 to get the actual number of edges.

Here is the calculation embedded in the response:
