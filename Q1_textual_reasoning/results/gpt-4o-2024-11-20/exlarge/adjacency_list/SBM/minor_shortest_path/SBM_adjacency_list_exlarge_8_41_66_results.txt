To find the length of the shortest path between node `41` and `66` in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS), a common algorithm for finding shortest paths in an unweighted graph.

### BFS Algorithm Steps:
1. Initialize a queue and start from the source node `41`.
2. Mark the starting node as visited and initialize its distance as `0`.
3. Explore all adjacent nodes and add them to the queue, updating their distances.
4. Repeat until either the target node `66` is reached or the queue is empty.

Here is the computed result:
