To calculate the shortest path length between nodes '34' and '38' using the adjacency list provided, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is the optimal algorithm for unweighted graphs. Let's find the answer:

### Approach:
1. Traverse the graph using BFS starting from node '34'.
2. Calculate the shortest distance to node '38'.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
```

### Explanation:
Using BFS:
- Node `34` connects directly to `35`, `30`, and other nodes.
- From `34` → `35` → `38`:
  - We reach node `38` from `34` in **3 steps**.
