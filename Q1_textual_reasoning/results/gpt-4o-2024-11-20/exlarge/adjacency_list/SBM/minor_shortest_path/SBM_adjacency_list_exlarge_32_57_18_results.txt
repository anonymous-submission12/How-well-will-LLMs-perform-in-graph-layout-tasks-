To calculate the shortest path between node '57' and node '18', we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS). This algorithm is particularly suited for unweighted graphs, as it finds the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.

We'll implement BFS to determine the shortest path length. Here's the response with the answer:
