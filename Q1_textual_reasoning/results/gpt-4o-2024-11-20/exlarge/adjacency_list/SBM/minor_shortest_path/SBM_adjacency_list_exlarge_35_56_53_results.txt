To solve this problem, I will calculate the shortest path between nodes `56` and `53` in the given graph, using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Here's the computation:

**Steps for BFS**:
1. Start from node `56`.
2. Explore all its neighbors.
3. Continue exploring neighbors of neighbors until `53` is reached.
4. Count the number of steps (edges).

Hereâ€™s the result in JSON format:
