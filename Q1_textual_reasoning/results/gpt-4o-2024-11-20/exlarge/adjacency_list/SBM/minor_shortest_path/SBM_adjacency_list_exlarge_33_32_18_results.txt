To calculate the shortest path between nodes '32' and '18' using the adjacency list representation of the graph, we can utilize BFS (Breadth-First Search), as it is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here's the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```

Explanation:
- From the adjacency list, node '32' is directly connected to node '18'. Hence, the shortest path length is 1.
