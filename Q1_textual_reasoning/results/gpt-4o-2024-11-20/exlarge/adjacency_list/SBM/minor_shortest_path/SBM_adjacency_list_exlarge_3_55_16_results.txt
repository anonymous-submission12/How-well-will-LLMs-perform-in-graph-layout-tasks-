To calculate the shortest path between nodes '55' and '16' in the given graph, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 5
}
```

Explanation:
Using BFS, the shortest path from node '55' to node '16' traverses through the following nodes: `55 -> 64 -> 3 -> 7 -> 16`. This path has a length of 5.
