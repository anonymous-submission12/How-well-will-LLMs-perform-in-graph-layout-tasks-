To calculate the length of the shortest path between node '24' and node '10' in the given graph (represented as an adjacency list), we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Let's perform the calculation:

### Algorithm:
1. Start BFS from node '24'.
2. Maintain a queue to track the current node and distance from the start node.
3. Stop when the BFS reaches node '10'.
4. Return the distance as the shortest path.

Here is the result of the calculation:

```json
{
  "answer": 3
}
``` 

The shortest path between node '24' and node '10' is **3** edges long.
