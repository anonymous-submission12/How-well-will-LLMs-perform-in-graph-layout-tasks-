To calculate the shortest path between node '52' and node '31', we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 6
}
```

Explanation:
1. Using BFS, we start from node '52' and explore its neighbors.
2. We continue exploring the graph level by level until we reach node '31'.
3. The shortest path length between node '52' and node '31' is 6.
