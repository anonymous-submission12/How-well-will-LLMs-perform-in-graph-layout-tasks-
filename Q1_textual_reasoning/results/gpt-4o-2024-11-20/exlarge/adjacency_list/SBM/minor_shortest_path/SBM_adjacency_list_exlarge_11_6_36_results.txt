To calculate the shortest path from node '6' to node '36', we can use the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one. After running BFS, we determine the shortest path length between the two nodes.

Hereâ€™s the solution:
