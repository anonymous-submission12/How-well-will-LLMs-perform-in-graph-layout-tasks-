To find the length of the shortest path between the nodes `64` and `59`, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here is the result of processing the graph:

```json
{
  "answer": 2
}
``` 

Explanation:
The shortest path between `64` and `59` has a direct connection through node `76`, resulting in a length of 2.
