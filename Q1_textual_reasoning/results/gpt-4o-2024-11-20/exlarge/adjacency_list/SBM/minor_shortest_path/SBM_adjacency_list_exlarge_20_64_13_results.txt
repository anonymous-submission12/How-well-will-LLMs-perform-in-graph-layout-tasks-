To calculate the shortest path between nodes `64` and `13` using the given adjacency list representation, a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm can be used, as it is well suited for unweighted graphs and guarantees the shortest path.

Here is the result wrapped in a JSON:

```json
{
  "answer": 8
}
```

If you'd like me to provide more details about the BFS steps or implementation, feel free to ask!
