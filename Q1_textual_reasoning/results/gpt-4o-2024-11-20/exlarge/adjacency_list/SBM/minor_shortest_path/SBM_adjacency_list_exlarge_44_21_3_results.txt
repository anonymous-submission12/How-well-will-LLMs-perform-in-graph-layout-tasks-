To determine the shortest path between node '21' and node '3' in the graph provided, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Below is the calculation of the shortest path, and the result wrapped in the required format.
