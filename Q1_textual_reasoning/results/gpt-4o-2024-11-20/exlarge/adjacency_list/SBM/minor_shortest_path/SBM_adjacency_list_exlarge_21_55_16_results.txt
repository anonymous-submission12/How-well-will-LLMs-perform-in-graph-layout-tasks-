To calculate the shortest path between nodes `55` and `16` using the given adjacency list, I will implement Breadth-First Search (BFS), as it is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. The BFS explores all neighbors at the current depth level before moving deeper.

Here's the result:

  "answer": 7
