To calculate the shortest path between nodes `29` and `38` in the given graph, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Here is the result:

```json
{
  "answer": 1
}
```

### Explanation:
- Node `29` is directly connected to node `38` in the adjacency list. Therefore, the shortest path length is `1`.
