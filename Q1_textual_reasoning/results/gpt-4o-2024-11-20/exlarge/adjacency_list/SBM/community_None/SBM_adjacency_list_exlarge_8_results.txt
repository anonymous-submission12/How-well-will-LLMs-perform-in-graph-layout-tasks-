To determine the number of communities in the graph based on the adjacency list given, we use a graph traversal technique, such as BFS (Breadth-First Search) or DFS (Depth-First Search), to identify connected components in the graph. Each connected component represents a community.

Here is the resulting JSON with the answer:
