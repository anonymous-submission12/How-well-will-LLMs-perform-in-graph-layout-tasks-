To count the number of communities in the given graph, we can use methods like Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) to identify connected components, as each connected component represents a community in the graph.

Analyzing and computing the number of connected components in the given graph:

### Step-by-step process:
1. Treat the given adjacency list as an undirected graph.
2. Traverse the graph using DFS or BFS to count the connected components.
3. If a node is visited during traversal, it is part of a known community (connected component).
4. Repeat until all nodes are visited, incrementing the counter for each new connected component.

The result representing the number of communities is as follows:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```
