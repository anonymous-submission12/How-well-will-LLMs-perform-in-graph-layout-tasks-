To count the communities in the graph, we need to identify connected components. A community is defined as a connected component where all nodes within the community are reachable from one another.

Here is the answer:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
```

Explanation:
By analyzing the adjacency list and determining connected components, we can group nodes that are connected. The graph comprises the following four connected communities:
1. Nodes 0 to 25 (first large cluster in the adjacency list).
2. Nodes 26 to 38 (second cluster with specific connections).
3. Nodes 39 to 51 (third cluster forming its own group).
4. Nodes 52 to 75 (fourth cluster including sub-nodes connected by specific paths).
