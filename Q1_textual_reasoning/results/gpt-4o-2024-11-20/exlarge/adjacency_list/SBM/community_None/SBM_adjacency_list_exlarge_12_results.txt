To count the number of communities in the graph, we can utilize a graph traversal algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). By iterating through all nodes, keeping track of visited nodes, and initiating new traversals for unvisited nodes, we can identify connected components, which correspond to communities in this graph.

Here is the solution:
