To determine the number of communities in the graph, we can use a community detection algorithm or analyze the connected components of the graph. Each connected component represents a community.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 6
}
```

Explanation:
The graph has 6 distinct connected components (communities). These are determined by analyzing the adjacency list and grouping nodes that are connected directly or indirectly.
