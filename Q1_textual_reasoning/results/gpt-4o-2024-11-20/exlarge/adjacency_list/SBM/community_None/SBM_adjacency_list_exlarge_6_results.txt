To calculate the number of communities in the graph, we can utilize community detection algorithms. Since you only provided the graph in an adjacency list format, let's use a simple approach to identify connected components within the graph, as connected components often represent communities in unweighted graphs.

Here is the solution:

```json
{
  "answer": 4
}
``` 

This graph has **4 communities** based on the connected components.
