To determine the number of distinct communities in the graph, we can use a graph traversal technique like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to identify connected components, as each connected component corresponds to a distinct community.

Here's the analysis:

```json
{
  "answer": 5
}
```

The graph consists of 5 distinct communities based on its structure. Each community corresponds to a connected component in the adjacency list.
