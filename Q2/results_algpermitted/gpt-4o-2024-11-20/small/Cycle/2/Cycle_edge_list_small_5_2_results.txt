Here is a Python script to generate a consistent graph layout. It uses the Kamada-Kawai layout algorithm, which is known for maintaining consistency between Euclidean distances and graph-theoretic distances. The output will be the graph layout in JSON format.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the edge list for the graph
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 24), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9),
    (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17),
    (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24)
]

# Create a graph using NetworkX
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Generate node positions using the Kamada-Kawai layout algorithm
positions = nx.kamada_kawai_layout(G)

# Convert positions to JSON-serializable format
layout = {node: pos.tolist() for node, pos in positions.items()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**:
   - The `edge_list` is defined as the input representation of the graph.
   - A graph `G` is created using the NetworkX library, and edges are added using `G.add_edges_from`.

2. **Kamada-Kawai Layout Algorithm**:
   - The `nx.kamada_kawai_layout` function computes positions for the nodes of the graph such that the Euclidean distances between nodes in 2D space are as similar as possible to the graph-theoretic distances.

3. **JSON Formatting**:
   - The positions are serialized into a Python dictionary where the key is the node, and the value is the 2D position (a list of x, y coordinates).
   - The dictionary is then converted into JSON format with indentation for readability.

4. **Output**:
   - The script outputs the graph layout as a JSON string. The positions can be further used for visualization or analysis.

### Note:
- This script does not include visualization or drawing of the graph. It only outputs the layout in JSON format, as per your request.
- Ensure you have the `networkx` library installed. You can install it using `pip install networkx` if it is not already available.
