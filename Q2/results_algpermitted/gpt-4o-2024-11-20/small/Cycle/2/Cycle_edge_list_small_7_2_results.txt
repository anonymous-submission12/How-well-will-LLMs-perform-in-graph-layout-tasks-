To generate a layout for the provided graph, we will use a graph layout algorithm that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance. A force-directed layout algorithm, such as the Kamada-Kawai layout, is well-suited for this purpose. We'll implement it using NetworkX, and the final output will be the graph layout coordinates in JSON format. Here is the Python code:

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Input edge list
edges = [
    (0, 1), (0, 26), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), 
    (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), 
    (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), 
    (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26)
]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edges)

# Compute a layout using the Kamada-Kawai algorithm
layout = nx.kamada_kawai_layout(G)

# Format the layout as a JSON output
layout_json = {node: position.tolist() for node, position in layout.items()}

# Print the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout_json, indent=2))
```

### Notes:
1. The Kamada-Kawai layout algorithm ensures that the graph is laid out in a way that the Euclidean distance between nodes corresponds approximately to their graph-theoretic distance.
2. The `.tolist()` method is used to convert NumPy arrays (from the layout) to standard Python lists for JSON serialization.

To run this script, ensure you have the `networkx` library installed in your Python environment. You can install it using `pip install networkx` if necessary.

The output of this code will provide a JSON-formatted dictionary where each node is a key, and its corresponding value is a list of 2D coordinates (`[x, y]`).
