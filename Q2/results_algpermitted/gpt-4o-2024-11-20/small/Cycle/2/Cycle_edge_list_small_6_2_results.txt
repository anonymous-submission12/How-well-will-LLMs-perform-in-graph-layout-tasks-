Below is a Python script to generate a graph layout based on an edge list using an existing layout algorithm to maintain consistency between Euclidean distances and graph-theoretic distances. The final result is the layout in JSON format.

```python
import json
import networkx as nx

# Define the graph edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 25), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), 
    (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), 
    (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), 
    (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25)
]

# Create the graph using NetworkX
graph = nx.Graph()
graph.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Calculate the layout using the spring layout to maintain consistency
# between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance
positions = nx.spring_layout(graph)

# Convert the layout to a dictionary format suitable for JSON
layout = {node: position.tolist() for node, position in positions.items()}

# Convert the layout to JSON format and print it
layout_json = json.dumps(layout, indent=4)
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. The graph is created from the given edge list using NetworkX.
2. The `spring_layout` function in NetworkX calculates a layout for the graph where nodes are positioned to minimize a spring force model (Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm). This maintains consistency between the Euclidean distance and the graph-theoretic distance.
3. The positions returned by `spring_layout` are converted into JSON-serializable format by converting numpy arrays to Python lists.
4. The layout is then formatted into JSON for readability.

You can run this Python script in an environment where `networkx` and `json` are available to obtain the graph layout.
