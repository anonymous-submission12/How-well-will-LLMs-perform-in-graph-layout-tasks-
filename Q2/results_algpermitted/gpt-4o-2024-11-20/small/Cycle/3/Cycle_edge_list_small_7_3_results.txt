Below is the Python script that generates a layout for the given graph using the `networkx` library. The layout minimizes edge crossings by using the `spring_layout` algorithm, which is a force-directed layout algorithm. The final output is the graph layout in JSON format.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 26), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8),
    (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16),
    (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23),
    (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26)
]

# Create a graph using NetworkX
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Generate the layout using the spring layout algorithm
layout = nx.spring_layout(G)

# Convert the layout to a JSON-serializable format
layout_json = {node: position.tolist() for node, position in layout.items()}

# Print the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout_json, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The `networkx` library is used to create a graph from the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Algorithm**: The `spring_layout` function is used to compute the positions of the nodes. This algorithm minimizes edge crossings by simulating a physical system where nodes repel each other and edges act as springs.
3. **JSON Conversion**: The layout dictionary is converted to a JSON-serializable format using `tolist()` for NumPy arrays.
4. **Output**: The layout is printed in JSON format.

You can run this script in a Python environment with the `networkx` library installed. The output will be a JSON object containing the positions of the nodes.
