Here is the Python code that computes the layout of a graph based on the edge list you provided. The layout uses the graph-theoretic distances to maintain consistency with Euclidean distances, leveraging the ForceAtlas2 layout algorithm provided in the `fa2` library:

```python
import json
import networkx as nx
from fa2 import ForceAtlas2

# Graph edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 12), (1, 2), (1, 13), (2, 3), (2, 14), (3, 4), (3, 15),
    (4, 5), (4, 16), (5, 6), (5, 17), (6, 7), (6, 18), (7, 8), (7, 19),
    (8, 9), (8, 20), (9, 10), (9, 21), (10, 11), (10, 22), (11, 23),
    (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19),
    (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23)
]

# Create a graph using NetworkX
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# ForceAtlas2 layout algorithm
forceatlas2 = ForceAtlas2(
    gravity=1.0,
    scalingRatio=2.0,
    strongGravityMode=False,
    verbose=False
)

# Compute positions using the ForceAtlas2 algorithm
positions = forceatlas2.forceatlas2_networkx_layout(G, pos=None, iterations=2000, linLogMode=True, edgeWeightInfluence=1.0)

# Convert positions to JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(positions)

# Output JSON layout
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Library Selection**:
   - `networkx`: Used to define the graph structure from the given edge list and perform computational operations on the graph.
   - `fa2`: Provides the ForceAtlas2 layout algorithm, which maintains consistency between Euclidean distances and graph-theoretic distances.

2. **Algorithm Details**:
   - ForceAtlas2 simulates forces (gravitational and repulsive) between nodes in the graph to position the nodes such that edge lengths approximate graph structure.

3. **JSON Output**:
   - The computed graph layout (positions of nodes) is converted into JSON format for easy use in further applications or visualization frameworks.

4. **Installation Requirements**:
   Run `pip install fa2` and `pip install networkx` to install the necessary libraries.

5. **Output**:
   The final `layout_json` is a stringified JSON representation of the layout positions, where the keys are node identifiers and values are `(x, y)` coordinates.

### Example Output:
```json
{
    "0": [0.0, 0.0],
    "1": [1.2, 0.8],
    "2": [2.4, 0.6],
    "3": [3.2, 1.1],
    ...
}
```
Replace the ellipsis with the actual computed positions.
