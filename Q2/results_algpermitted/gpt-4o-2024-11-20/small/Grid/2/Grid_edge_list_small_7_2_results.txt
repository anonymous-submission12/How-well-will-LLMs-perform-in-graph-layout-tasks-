Below is the Python script that generates a layout for the given graph using the Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed algorithm, which maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance. The output is a JSON representation of the graph layout.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 8), (2, 3), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 10), 
    (4, 5), (4, 11), (5, 6), (5, 12), (6, 13), (7, 8), (7, 14), (8, 9), 
    (8, 15), (9, 10), (9, 16), (10, 11), (10, 17), (11, 12), (11, 18), 
    (12, 13), (12, 19), (13, 20), (14, 15), (14, 21), (15, 16), (15, 22), 
    (16, 17), (16, 23), (17, 18), (17, 24), (18, 19), (18, 25), (19, 20), 
    (19, 26), (20, 27), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26), 
    (26, 27)
]

# Create a graph using NetworkX
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Generate the layout using the Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed algorithm
layout = nx.spring_layout(G)

# Convert the layout to a JSON-serializable format
layout_json = {node: position.tolist() for node, position in layout.items()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout_json, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The `networkx.Graph()` object is created, and the edges from the provided edge list are added to it.
2. **Layout Generation**: The `spring_layout` function from NetworkX is used to compute the layout. This function implements the Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed algorithm, which ensures that the Euclidean distances between nodes in the layout are proportional to their graph-theoretic distances.
3. **JSON Serialization**: The layout dictionary is converted to a JSON-serializable format by converting NumPy arrays (used internally by NetworkX) to Python lists.
4. **Output**: The layout is printed in JSON format with indentation for readability.

You can run this script in a Python environment with NetworkX installed to generate the graph layout.
