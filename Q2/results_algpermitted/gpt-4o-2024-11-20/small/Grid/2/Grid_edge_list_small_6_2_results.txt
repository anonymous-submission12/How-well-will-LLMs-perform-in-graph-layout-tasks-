Below is a Python script that generates a layout for the graph while maintaining consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance. The script uses the `networkx` library to compute the layout with the `spring_layout` algorithm, which accomplishes this consistency. The final output is the graph layout in JSON format.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Edge list of the graph
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 10), (3, 4), (3, 11),
    (4, 5), (4, 12), (5, 6), (5, 13), (6, 7), (6, 14), (7, 15), (8, 9),
    (8, 16), (9, 10), (9, 17), (10, 11), (10, 18), (11, 12), (11, 19),
    (12, 13), (12, 20), (13, 14), (13, 21), (14, 15), (14, 22), (15, 23),
    (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23)
]

# Create a NetworkX graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Generate the graph layout using the spring_layout algorithm
positions = nx.spring_layout(G)

# Convert positions to JSON format
positions_json = json.dumps(positions)

# Output the JSON layout
print(positions_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input:** The edge list defines the graph structure. You provide this as input to the script.
2. **Graph Construction:** The graph is constructed using `networkx.Graph()` and `add_edges_from` method.
3. **Layout Computation:** `spring_layout` is a force-directed layout algorithm that positions nodes in a way that reflects their graph-theoretic distance in Euclidean space.
4. **JSON Conversion:** `positions` is a dictionary where keys are node identifiers and values are (x, y) coordinates. This dictionary is converted into a JSON object for output.
5. **Output:** The layout is printed in JSON format.

You can run this script and use the JSON output for further processing or visualization outside Python!
