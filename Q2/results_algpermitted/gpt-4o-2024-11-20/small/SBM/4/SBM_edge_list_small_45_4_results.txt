Here is a Python script that generates a layout for the provided graph in JSON format. The layout ensures that communities are clearly separated by using a module-based community detection algorithm to group nodes into communities, and then applying a layout algorithm that respects the community structure.

The script uses the `networkx` library for graph operations and the Louvain algorithm for community detection via the `community` package. The `forceatlas2` layout algorithm from the `fa2` package is used to position the nodes cleanly based on community relationships.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json
from community import community_louvain
from fa2 import ForceAtlas2

# Graph data
edge_list = [(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), 
             (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), 
             (7, 11), (7, 14), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), (12, 13), 
             (12, 14), (12, 17), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (13, 23), (14, 15), (14, 17), 
             (15, 16), (15, 17), (16, 17), (16, 22), (18, 19), (18, 21), (18, 22), (18, 23), 
             (19, 20), (19, 21), (19, 22), (20, 21), (20, 22), (20, 23), (21, 22), (21, 23), 
             (22, 23)]

# Create a graph
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Detect communities
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Add communities as a node attribute
for node, community_id in partition.items():
    G.nodes[node]['community'] = community_id

# Create a ForceAtlas2 layout
forceatlas2 = ForceAtlas2(
    outboundAttractionDistribution=False,
    linLogMode=False,
    adjustSizes=False,
    edgeWeightInfluence=1.0,
    jitterTolerance=1.0,
    barnesHutOptimize=True,
    barnesHutTheta=1.2,
    scalingRatio=2.0,
    strongGravityMode=False,
    gravity=1.0
)

# Compute node positions
positions = forceatlas2.forceatlas2_networkx_layout(G, pos=None, iterations=2000)

# Combine positions with community information
layout = {node: {"x": pos[0], "y": pos[1], "community": partition[node]} 
          for node, pos in positions.items()}

# Output the layout as JSON
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:

1. The edge list is used to create a graph `G` with the `networkx` library.
2. Community detection is done with the Louvain algorithm (`community` library). Each node is assigned a community ID.
3. The `ForceAtlas2` layout algorithm from the `fa2` library is used to generate node positions. This layout algorithm respects the modular structure of the graph by keeping nodes within communities closer together and separating different communities more visibly.
4. Node positions and community assignments are combined into a dictionary `layout`, where:
   - Each node has an "x" and "y" coordinate, and its "community" is specified.
5. The final result is output as a JSON-formatted string.

### Installation of Required Libraries:
To run the script, make sure the required libraries are installed:
```bash
pip install networkx python-louvain fa2
```
