Below is the Python script that generates a graph layout in JSON format while preserving the community structure. The script uses the `networkx` library for graph manipulation and the `community` module for community detection. The layout is generated using the `spring_layout` algorithm, which is suitable for visualizing community structures.

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import json

# Input graph data
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 16), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9), 
    (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 11), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 27), (5, 16), (6, 7), (6, 8), 
    (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), 
    (9, 10), (9, 11), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 16), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 17), 
    (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (15, 16), (15, 17), (16, 17), (16, 19), (18, 19), 
    (18, 21), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 22), (20, 21), (20, 22), (23, 27), (24, 26), 
    (24, 27), (25, 26), (25, 27), (26, 27)
]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Detect communities using the Louvain method
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Generate a layout using the spring layout algorithm
# The spring layout algorithm is suitable for visualizing community structures
pos = nx.spring_layout(G)

# Combine positions with community information
layout_with_communities = {
    node: {
        "x": pos[node][0],
        "y": pos[node][1],
        "community": partition[node]
    }
    for node in G.nodes()
}

# Convert the layout to JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(layout_with_communities, indent=4)

# Print the JSON layout
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created using the `networkx` library from the provided edge list.
2. **Community Detection**: The `community_louvain.best_partition` function is used to detect communities in the graph. Each node is assigned to a community.
3. **Layout Generation**: The `spring_layout` algorithm is used to generate positions for the nodes. This algorithm is well-suited for visualizing community structures.
4. **Output Format**: The positions and community assignments are combined into a dictionary, which is then converted to JSON format for output.

### Output:
The output is a JSON object where each node has its `x` and `y` coordinates and its community assignment. This format can be used for further processing or visualization in external tools.
