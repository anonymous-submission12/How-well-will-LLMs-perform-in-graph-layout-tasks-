Below is the Python script to take the provided edge list, detect communities using a modularity-based approach, and compute a graph layout that separates communities clearly. The script uses `networkx` for defining the graph and applying community detection and `community-louvain` for modularity-based community detection.

The final output will be the layout positions in JSON format.

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain  # community-louvain package
import json

# Define the graph from the edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 10), (0, 20),
             (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (1, 11),
             (1, 12), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10),
             (2, 12), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), (4, 5),
             (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10), (4, 11), (4, 12), (5, 6),
             (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (5, 10), (5, 12), (6, 10), (6, 11),
             (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 11), (7, 12), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 14),

             (13, 16), (13, 17), (13, 18), (13, 19), (13, 20), (13, 21),
             (13, 22), (13, 24), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18),
             (14, 19), (14, 20), (14, 21), (14, 22), (14, 23), (14, 24),

             (17, 20), (17, 21), (17, 22), (17, 24), (18, 20), (18, 24),
             (19, 20), (19, 22), (19, 23), (19, 24), (20, 22), (20, 23),
             (20, 24), (21, 22), (21, 23), (21, 24), (22, 23), (23, 24)]

G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Community detection using Louvain algorithm
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Generate a layout for the graph, using Fruchterman-Reingold Algorithm (force-directed layout)
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)  # Fixed seed for reproducibility

# Modify layout to enhance community structure clarity
for node, community in partition.items():
    # Offset positions slightly by community to create visual separation
    community_offset = community * 2.0  # Adjust separation scaling as needed
    pos[node][0] += community_offset  # Offset x-coordinate
    pos[node][1] += community_offset  # Offset y-coordinate

# Convert positions to a JSON-serializable dictionary
layout_json = {node: [float(coord) for coord in coords] for node, coords in pos.items()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout_json, indent=2))

### Explanation:

1. **Graph Construction**:
   We use the provided edge list to build a graph (`G`) using the `networkx` library.

2. **Community Detection**:
   The `community-louvain` library is used to identify modularity-based communities. The `partition` variable maps each node to its community.

3. **Layout Computation**:
   The layout is initially generated with the `spring_layout` algorithm (force-directed) for a clear visualization structure. To further emphasize community structures, the layout positions for nodes are offset based on their community IDs.

4. **Output Format**:
   The layout is converted into a JSON-serializable format (dictionary of node positions) and printed as a JSON object.

To run the script, ensure the following packages are installed: `networkx` and `python-louvain` (`community-louvain`). Install them via `pip install networkx community-louvain`.
