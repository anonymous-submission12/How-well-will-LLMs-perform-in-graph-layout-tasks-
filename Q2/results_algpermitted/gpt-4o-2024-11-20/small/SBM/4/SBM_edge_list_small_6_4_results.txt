Below is the Python script that generates a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear. The script uses the `networkx` library for graph representation and the `community` module (from the `python-louvain` package) for community detection. The layout is generated using the `spring_layout` algorithm, which is adjusted to emphasize the community structure.

The final output is a JSON object containing the node positions.

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import json

# Input graph data
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6),
    (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 24), (5, 6), (7, 8),
    (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 12), (8, 12), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), (10, 12), (11, 12),
    (12, 24), (13, 16), (13, 17), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18), (15, 16), (16, 17),
    (17, 18), (18, 23), (19, 21), (19, 22), (19, 23), (20, 21), (20, 22), (20, 24), (21, 22),
    (21, 23), (21, 24), (22, 23), (22, 24), (23, 24)
]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Detect communities using the Louvain method
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Create a spring layout with community structure emphasized
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, k=0.15, seed=42)  # k controls the spacing between nodes

# Adjust positions to emphasize community structure
for node, community in partition.items():
    # Offset positions based on community
    pos[node] = [coord + community * 5 for coord in pos[node]]

# Convert positions to JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(pos)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created using the `networkx` library from the provided edge list.
2. **Community Detection**: The Louvain method (via the `community` module) is used to detect communities in the graph. Each node is assigned to a community.
3. **Spring Layout**: The `spring_layout` algorithm is used to generate node positions. The `k` parameter controls the spacing between nodes.
4. **Community Adjustment**: Node positions are adjusted by adding an offset based on their community to make the community structure more visually distinct.
5. **JSON Output**: The final positions are converted to a JSON object and printed.

You can run this script in a Python environment with the required libraries (`networkx` and `python-louvain`) installed. The output will be a JSON string containing the node positions.
