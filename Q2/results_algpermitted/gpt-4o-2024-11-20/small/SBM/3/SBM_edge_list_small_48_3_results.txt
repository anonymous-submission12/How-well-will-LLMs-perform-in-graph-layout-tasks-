Here is the Python code script designed to generate a graph layout that minimizes edge crossings using existing graph layout algorithms such as the Kamada-Kawai or Fruchterman-Reingold methods. The output is saved in JSON format, representing node positions. For this, we will use the NetworkX library to compute the layout positions.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the input edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 12), (1, 2), (1, 3), 
             (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9), (1, 10), (1, 11), (1, 12), (1, 13), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 10),
             (2, 11), (2, 12), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 10), (4, 11),
             (4, 12), (4, 20), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 11), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 11), (6, 12), (7, 8), (7, 9),
             (7, 11), (7, 12), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (8, 12), (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 12), (10, 11), (10, 12), (11, 12),
             (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 18), (13, 20), (13, 21), (13, 22), (13, 23), (13, 24), (14, 15), (14, 17),
             (14, 18), (14, 20), (14, 21), (14, 22), (14, 23), (14, 24), (15, 16), (15, 17), (15, 18), (15, 19), (15, 21),
             (15, 22), (15, 23), (15, 24), (15, 25), (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 19), (16, 20), (16, 22), (16, 25), (17, 18),
             (17, 20), (17, 22), (17, 25), (18, 19), (18, 20), (18, 22), (18, 24), (18, 25), (19, 20), (19, 22), (19, 24),
             (19, 25), (20, 21), (20, 23), (20, 24), (21, 22), (21, 23), (21, 24), (21, 25), (22, 23), (22, 25), (23, 24),
             (23, 25), (24, 25)]

# Create a graph using NetworkX
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Generate a graph layout using the Kamada-Kawai method (or Fruchterman-Reingold)
layout_positions = nx.kamada_kawai_layout(G)  # This layout minimizes edge crossings.

# Convert the layout to a JSON serializable format
layout_dict = {node: pos.tolist() for node, pos in layout_positions.items()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(layout_dict, indent=4)
print(layout_json)
```

### Steps the script performs:
1. **Graph Construction**: The edge list is used to define a graph in NetworkX.
2. **Layout Computation**: The script applies the `kamada_kawai_layout` method to compute positions for nodes. This method aims to minimize edge crossings and generate a visually appealing layout.
3. **Serialization to JSON**: The computed positions are converted into a JSON-compatible format and serialized into a JSON object.
4. **Output as JSON**: Finally, the script prints the JSON representing the graph layout.

You can copy and run this script in an environment with NetworkX and JSON installed.
