Below is the Python script to generate a layout for the given graph. The code uses the `networkx` library to compute a layout with a force-directed algorithm (`spring_layout`) that minimizes edge crossings. Finally, the layout is converted into JSON format as the output.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 3),
    (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4),
    (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 24), (5, 6), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10),
    (7, 11), (7, 12), (8, 12), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), (10, 12),
    (11, 12), (12, 24), (13, 16), (13, 17), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17),
    (14, 18), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 23), (19, 21), (19, 22),
    (19, 23), (20, 21), (20, 22), (20, 24), (21, 22), (21, 23), (21, 24),
    (22, 23), (22, 24), (23, 24)
]

# Create a graph using NetworkX
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Compute the positions of the nodes using a force-directed layout
positions = nx.spring_layout(G)

# Convert positions to a JSON-compatible format
layout_json = json.dumps({node: pos.tolist() for node, pos in positions.items()}, indent=4)

# Print the JSON output
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
- `networkx` is used to create the graph from the provided edge list.
- The `spring_layout` function is a force-directed algorithm that attempts to minimize edge crossings by simulating a physical system where nodes repel each other and edges act like springs.
- Layout positions are stored in a dictionary, where keys are node IDs and values are 2D coordinates (x, y).
- The positions are converted to JSON using the `json.dumps` function. The positions are converted to lists using `.tolist()` since NumPy arrays are not JSON-serializable.

### Output:
Running the script will generate JSON containing node positions in a format like:

```json
{
    "0": [x0, y0],
    "1": [x1, y1],
    "2": [x2, y2],
    ...
}
```

Make sure you have `networkx` installed:

```bash
pip install networkx
```

You don't need to visualize the graph; this script generates the optimized layout as JSON.
