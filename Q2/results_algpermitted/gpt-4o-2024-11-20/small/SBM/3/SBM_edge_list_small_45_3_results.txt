Here's a Python script to generate a layout for the given graph using a layout generation algorithm that minimizes edge crossings. The script employs the `networkx` library for graph representation and layout computation, but it only outputs the positions in JSON format and does not draw the graph.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the graph edges
edge_list = [(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5),
             (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10),
             (7, 11), (7, 14), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), (12, 13),
             (12, 14), (12, 17), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (13, 23), (14, 15), (14, 17),
             (15, 16), (15, 17), (16, 17), (16, 22), (18, 19), (18, 21), (18, 22), (18, 23),
             (19, 20), (19, 21), (19, 22), (20, 21), (20, 22), (20, 23), (21, 22), (21, 23),
             (22, 23)]

# Create a graph object
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Compute the layout using the Spring layout (minimizes edge crossings heuristically)
positions = nx.spring_layout(G)

# Convert positions to JSON serializable format
positions_json = {str(node): {'x': float(pos[0]), 'y': float(pos[1])} for node, pos in positions.items()}

# Print the layout as JSON
print(json.dumps(positions_json, indent=4))
```

### Steps Taken in the Code:
1. Parsed the input edge list and created a graph `G` using the `networkx` library.
2. Used the `spring_layout` algorithm of `networkx`, which heuristically minimizes edge crossings by simulating forces between nodes and edges.
3. Transformed the positions into a JSON-serializable format, ensuring coordinate values are output as numbers (float).
4. Printed the layout in JSON format, with each node's position specified as an (x, y) coordinate.

### Sample Output (Partial JSON)
After running the script, you will get a JSON output like:
```json
{
    "0": {"x": 0.025482829987099648, "y": 0.6952664848375724},
    "1": {"x": 0.596246487875406, "y": 0.7853348826784976},
    "2": {"x": 0.14189797333199886, "y": 0.6677265368095786},
    ...
}
```
Each node is represented as a key, and its value contains `x` and `y` coordinates. You can use this JSON in further processing or plotting.
