Here is a Python script that generates a graph layout with minimal edge crossings. The code uses the `igraph` library for this purpose and generates the layout in JSON format. The `igraph` library provides force-directed layout algorithms like "Fruchterman-Reingold" or "Kamada-Kawai" that can help minimize edge crossings.

Make sure to install the required library (`python-igraph`) by running `pip install python-igraph` before executing the code.

```python
import igraph as ig
import json

# Define the edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 10), (0, 20),
    (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (1, 11), (1, 12),
    (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10), (2, 12),
    (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7),
    (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10), (4, 11), (4, 12), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9),
    (5, 10), (5, 12), (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 11), (7, 12),
    (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 14), (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 12), (9, 14), (11, 12),
    (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (13, 18), (13, 19), (13, 20),
    (13, 21), (13, 22), (13, 24), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18),
    (14, 19), (14, 20), (14, 21), (14, 22), (14, 23), (14, 24), (15, 16),
    (15, 17), (15, 18), (15, 19), (15, 21), (15, 22), (15, 24), (16, 17),
    (16, 20), (16, 22), (16, 24), (17, 19), (17, 20), (17, 21), (17, 22),
    (17, 24), (18, 20), (18, 24), (19, 20), (19, 22), (19, 23), (19, 24),
    (20, 22), (20, 23), (20, 24), (21, 22), (21, 23), (21, 24), (22, 23),
    (23, 24)
]

# Create a graph from the edge list
graph = ig.Graph(edges=edge_list)

# Generate a layout using a force-directed algorithm (Fruchterman-Reingold)
layout = graph.layout("fruchterman_reingold")

# Convert layout to JSON format
positions = {str(v.index): {"x": pos[0], "y": pos[1]} for v, pos in zip(graph.vs, layout.coords)}

# Output the JSON layout
json_output = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)
print(json_output)
```

### What this script does:
1. **Input Graph**: It processes the given edge list to create a graph object using the `igraph` library.
2. **Force-Directed Layout**: It calculates node positions using the "Fruchterman-Reingold" layout algorithm, designed to minimize edge crossings and create aesthetically pleasing graphs.
3. **Export to JSON**: The script converts the layout coordinates into JSON format, where the positions of each node are represented as `(x, y)` coordinates.

### Example of JSON Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key represents a node ID, and its corresponding value is an object with `x` and `y` coordinates.

```json
{
    "0": {"x": -0.45, "y": 0.75},
    "1": {"x": -0.35, "y": 0.63},
    "2": {"x": -0.20, "y": 0.52},
    ...
    "24": {"x": 0.45, "y": -0.75}
}
```

You can use this output for further visualization or processing without relying on graph plotting libraries like `matplotlib` or `networkx`.
