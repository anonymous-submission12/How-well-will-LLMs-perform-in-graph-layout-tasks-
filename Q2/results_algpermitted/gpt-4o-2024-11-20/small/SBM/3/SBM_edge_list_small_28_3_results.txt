Below is the Python script that generates a layout for the given graph using a layout algorithm that minimizes edge crossings. The script uses the `networkx` library to compute the layout and outputs the layout in JSON format.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 11), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10),
    (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10),
    (3, 11), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (5, 10), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9),
    (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (9, 11), (9, 22), (12, 13), (12, 14),
    (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17), (12, 18), (12, 19), (12, 20), (12, 21), (12, 22), (12, 23), (13, 14), (13, 15),
    (13, 16), (13, 18), (13, 19), (13, 20), (13, 22), (13, 23), (14, 15), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (14, 20),
    (14, 22), (14, 23), (15, 16), (15, 17), (15, 18), (15, 19), (15, 22), (15, 23), (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 19),
    (16, 22), (16, 23), (17, 19), (17, 20), (17, 21), (17, 22), (17, 23), (18, 20), (18, 21), (18, 23), (19, 21),
    (19, 23), (20, 21), (20, 22), (21, 22), (21, 23)
]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Compute the layout using the spring layout algorithm
# The spring layout algorithm attempts to minimize edge crossings
layout = nx.spring_layout(G)

# Convert the layout to a JSON-serializable format
layout_json = {node: pos.tolist() for node, pos in layout.items()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout_json, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The `networkx` library is used to create a graph from the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Algorithm**: The `spring_layout` algorithm is used to compute the layout. This algorithm models the graph as a physical system where nodes repel each other and edges act as springs, minimizing edge crossings.
3. **JSON Output**: The computed layout is converted into a JSON-serializable format and printed as a JSON object.

### Output:
The script will output the graph layout in JSON format, where each node is mapped to its 2D position (x, y). You can run the script in a Python environment to see the result.
