Here is the Python script to generate a graph layout while maintaining consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance. We'll utilize the Fruchterman-Reingold Force-Directed Algorithm provided by the `networkx` library. The output will be in JSON format.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Edge list of the graph provided
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 10), (0, 20), (1, 2), (1, 3), 
    (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (1, 11), (1, 12), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), 
    (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10), (2, 12), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), 
    (3, 10), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10), (4, 11), (4, 12), (5, 6), 
    (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (5, 10), (5, 12), (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 11), 
    (7, 12), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 14), (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 12), (9, 14), (11, 12), 
    (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (13, 18), (13, 19), (13, 20), (13, 21), 
    (13, 22), (13, 24), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (14, 20), 
    (14, 21), (14, 22), (14, 23), (14, 24), (15, 16), (15, 17), (15, 18), (15, 19), 
    (15, 21), (15, 22), (15, 24), (16, 17), (16, 20), (16, 22), (16, 24), (17, 19), 
    (17, 20), (17, 21), (17, 22), (17, 24), (18, 20), (18, 24), (19, 20), (19, 22), 
    (19, 23), (19, 24), (20, 22), (20, 23), (20, 24), (21, 22), (21, 23), (21, 24), 
    (22, 23), (23, 24)
]

# Create a graph using NetworkX
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Generate layout positions for the graph nodes using the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm
# spring_layout provides a force-directed layout
positions = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)  # Seed ensures reproducibility

# Convert positions to a JSON serializable format
positions_json = {str(node): pos.tolist() for node, pos in positions.items()}

# Print the JSON output
print(json.dumps(positions_json, indent=4))
```

### What This Script Does:
1. **Input Graph Construction:** The script takes the provided edge list and builds a graph using `networkx.Graph`.
2. **Graph Layout:** The `spring_layout` function (which uses the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm) is used to calculate the layout positions while maintaining consistency between Euclidean and graph-theoretic distances.
3. **JSON Output:** The layout (a dictionary mapping nodes to [x, y] positions) is serialized into JSON format for the final output.

### Output:
The output is a JSON object with nodes as keys (converted to strings) and corresponding positions as [x, y] coordinates.

**Note:** Since the output depends on a random initialization step, the `seed=42` ensures the layout is deterministic and reproducible across runs.
