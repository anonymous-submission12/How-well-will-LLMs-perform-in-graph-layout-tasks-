To generate a graph layout that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use existing graph layout algorithms like the force-directed layout algorithms provided by libraries like `networkx`. These algorithms optimize node positions such that node pairs closer in graph-theoretic distance are also closer in Euclidean space.

Below is the Python code to compute the graph layout positions and output them in JSON format:

```python
import json
import networkx as nx

# Edge list of the graph
edge_list = [
    (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 4),
    (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 22), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7),
    (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (8, 10), (8, 11), (8, 12), (8, 13), (8, 14),
    (8, 15), (9, 11), (9, 12), (9, 13), (9, 14), (9, 15), (10, 11), (10, 12),
    (10, 13), (10, 14), (10, 15), (11, 12), (11, 13), (12, 13), (12, 14),
    (12, 15), (13, 14), (13, 15), (14, 18), (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 20),
    (16, 21), (16, 22), (17, 19), (17, 20), (17, 21), (17, 22), (18, 19),
    (18, 20), (18, 21), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 21), (19, 22), (20, 21)
]

# Create graph from edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Compute graph layout using spring layout (force-directed algorithm)
pos = nx.spring_layout(G)

# Convert positions to JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(pos)

# Output the JSON layout
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Edge List Input**: The graph is defined as an edge list.
2. **Graph Creation**: The `networkx` library is used to create a graph from the edge list.
3. **Spring Layout**: The `nx.spring_layout()` function calculates node positions based on a force-directed layout algorithm, which minimizes strain between nodes, ensuring that closer-paired nodes in the graph-theoretic sense are also closer in Euclidean space.
4. **JSON Output**: The layout is converted into JSON format using Python's `json` library.
5. **Print JSON**: The final graph layout in JSON format is printed for further use.

You can modify this code to save the output JSON to a file or return it directly from a function. Let me know if you need further assistance!
