Here is a Python script to generate a graph layout using an existing graph layout algorithm. Specifically, this script uses the `spring_layout` algorithm provided by NetworkX to determine positions such that the Euclidean distance between nodes corresponds, roughly, to the graph-theoretic (shortest path) distance. The final result is output in JSON format.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the graph as an edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 12),
    (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (1, 11),
    (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10),
    (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 10),
    (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 9),
    (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 9), (5, 11),
    (6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 11),
    (7, 9), (7, 11),
    (8, 9), (8, 11),
    (9, 10), (9, 11),
    (10, 11), (10, 12),
    (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17), (12, 18), (12, 19), (12, 20), (12, 22),
    (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (13, 18), (13, 20), (13, 21),
    (14, 15), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (14, 20), (14, 22),
    (15, 17), (15, 18), (15, 19), (15, 20), (15, 21), (15, 22),
    (16, 18), (16, 20), (16, 21), (16, 22),
    (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 22),
    (18, 19), (18, 20), (18, 21), (18, 22),
    (19, 22), (20, 22), (21, 22)
]

# Create a graph using NetworkX
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Compute the spring layout for the graph
# The spring layout aims to position nodes to reflect graph-theoretic distances
layout = nx.spring_layout(G)

# Convert layout (positions) to a JSON-compatible format
layout_json = {str(node): position.tolist() for node, position in layout.items()}

# Output the layout as JSON
print(json.dumps(layout_json, indent=4))
```

### Notes:

1. The `spring_layout` algorithm places nodes in such a way that the Euclidean distance corresponds roughly to the graph-theoretic distance while minimizing a force-directed energy function.
   
2. The layout is returned as a dictionary, where keys are node IDs (converted to strings for JSON compatibility) and values are 2D coordinates `[x, y]`.

3. The positions are output in JSON format with indentation to make it human-readable.

4. This script does not use `matplotlib` or any other visualization library to draw the graph explicitly.

You can run this code in a Python environment with NetworkX installed. The final output of positions is provided in JSON format.
