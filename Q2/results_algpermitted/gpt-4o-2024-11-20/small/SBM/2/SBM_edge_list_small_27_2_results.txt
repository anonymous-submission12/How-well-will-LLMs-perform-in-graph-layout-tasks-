Below is the Python script that generates a layout for the given graph using an algorithm that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, such as the Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed algorithm. The resultant layout is exported in a JSON format.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Input graph data as edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 16), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9), 
    (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 11), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 27), (5, 16), (6, 7), (6, 8), 
    (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), 
    (9, 10), (9, 11), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 16), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 17), 
    (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (15, 16), (15, 17), (16, 17), (16, 19), (18, 19), 
    (18, 21), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 22), (20, 21), (20, 22), (23, 27), (24, 26), 
    (24, 27), (25, 26), (25, 27), (26, 27)
]

# Create a Graph object from the edge list
graph = nx.Graph()
graph.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Generate a layout for the graph using the Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed algorithm
positions = nx.spring_layout(graph)

# Convert positions to a dictionary with node keys and coordinates
positions_json = {str(node): pos.tolist() for node, pos in positions.items()}

# Output positions in JSON format
print(json.dumps(positions_json, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**:
   - The input `edge_list` is parsed to create a `networkx.Graph()` object, which makes it easy to work with the graph structure.

2. **Layout Computation**:
   - The `nx.spring_layout()` function implements the Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed algorithm, which positions nodes in 2D space. This ensures that the Euclidean distances between the positions are reasonably proportional to the graph-theoretic distances.

3. **JSON Conversion**:
   - The `positions_json` dictionary maps node labels to their (x, y) coordinates as lists, ensuring compatibility with JSON format.

4. **Output**:
   - The layout is output as a JSON-formatted dictionary, with node labels being stringified for compatibility with typical JSON conventions.

You can run this script to get the positions of each node in the graph. The output will be in the format:
```json
{
    "0": [x0, y0],
    "1": [x1, y1],
    ...
    "27": [x27, y27]
}
```
