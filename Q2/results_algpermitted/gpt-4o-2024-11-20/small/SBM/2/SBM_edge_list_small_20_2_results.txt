Here is the Python script to generate a graph layout where the Euclidean distance is consistent with the graph-theoretic distance. The script uses the `networkx` library for graph representation and positioning and the `json` library to output the layout in JSON format. We use the `spring_layout` method from `networkx`, which leverages a force-directed algorithm to achieve the desired consistency.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the edge list for the graph
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 5), 
    (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 19), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 8), 
    (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (8, 9), (8, 10), (10, 11), (11, 15), (12, 13), 
    (12, 14), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 16), 
    (13, 21), (14, 15), (14, 16), (16, 17), (18, 19), (18, 20), (18, 21), 
    (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 21), (20, 21), (20, 22), (21, 22), (22, 26), 
    (23, 24), (23, 25), (23, 26), (24, 25), (24, 27), (25, 26), (25, 27), 
    (26, 27)
]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Generate a spring layout (force-directed layout)
# This layout ensures consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance.
positions = nx.spring_layout(G)

# Convert positions to a JSON serializable format
positions_json = {node: position.tolist() for node, position in positions.items()}

# Print the positions in JSON format
print(json.dumps(positions_json, indent=4))
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is created using `networkx.Graph()` and populated with the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Algorithm**: The `nx.spring_layout()` uses a force-directed algorithm, which simulates physics (springs and repulsion) to position nodes in a way that preserves the relative graph-theoretic distances.
3. **JSON Conversion**: The positions generated by the layout are in a NumPy array format. These are converted to regular Python lists using `.tolist()` for JSON serialization.
4. **Output**: The final positions are outputted in JSON format with an indentation of 4 for readability.

You can run this script, and it will output the positions of the nodes as a JSON object.
