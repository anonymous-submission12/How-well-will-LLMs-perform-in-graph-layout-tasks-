Here's the Python script to generate the graph layout as JSON, using the `networkx` library's spring layout algorithm. The spring layout attempts to maintain consistency between the Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Edge list representing the graph
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), 
    (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), 
    (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), 
    (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), 
    (4, 6), (4, 24), 
    (5, 6), 
    (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 12), 
    (8, 12), 
    (9, 10), (9, 11), 
    (10, 11), (10, 12), 
    (11, 12), 
    (12, 24), 
    (13, 16), (13, 17), 
    (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18), 
    (15, 16), (16, 17), 
    (17, 18), 
    (18, 23),
    (19, 21), (19, 22), (19, 23), 
    (20, 21), (20, 22), (20, 24), 
    (21, 22), (21, 23), (21, 24), 
    (22, 23), (22, 24), 
    (23, 24)
]

# Create a graph object
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Generate positions using the spring layout algorithm
positions = nx.spring_layout(G)

# Convert positions to JSON format
position_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)

# Output the positions in JSON format
print(position_json)
```

### Explanation of the Approach:

1. **`networkx` Setup**:
   - We use the `networkx` library to work with the graph represented as an edge list.

2. **Spring Layout**:
   - The `spring_layout` function is used to compute the positions of nodes in the graph such that the Euclidean distances between nodes approximate the graph-theoretic distances.

3. **Serialization**:
   - The positions (output of the layout algorithm) are converted to a JSON-formatted string using `json.dumps`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The node positions are printed in JSON format.

### Notes:
- You can run the code and use the output (`position_json`) in JSON format for further processing or visualization.
- Ensure that `networkx` and `json` modules are installed and available in your Python environment.
