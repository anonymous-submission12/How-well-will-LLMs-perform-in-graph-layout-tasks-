Here is the Python script that generates a layout for the given graph using an existing graph layout algorithm. The script uses the `networkx` library to compute the layout and outputs the positions in JSON format.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9),
    (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16),
    (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23)
]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Compute the layout using the spring layout algorithm
# The spring layout minimizes edge crossings and distributes nodes evenly
layout = nx.spring_layout(G)

# Convert the layout to a JSON-serializable format
layout_json = {node: position.tolist() for node, position in layout.items()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout_json, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The `networkx` library is used to create a graph from the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Algorithm**: The `spring_layout` algorithm is used to compute the positions of the nodes. This algorithm is based on a force-directed layout, which minimizes edge crossings and distributes nodes evenly.
3. **JSON Serialization**: The computed layout is converted into a JSON-serializable format (lists instead of NumPy arrays) and printed in JSON format.

You can run this script in a Python environment with the `networkx` library installed. The output will be the graph layout in JSON format, where each node is mapped to its position in 2D space.
