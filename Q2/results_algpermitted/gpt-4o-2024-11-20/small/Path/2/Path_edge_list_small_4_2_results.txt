Here is the Python code to generate a consistent layout for the provided graph while maintaining the relationship between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance. The layout is computed using the Kamada-Kawai layout, which ensures this type of consistency. The final output is in JSON format.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the edge list for the graph
edge_list = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), 
             (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), 
             (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), 
             (22, 23)]

# Create a Graph object using NetworkX
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Compute a Kamada-Kawai layout (ensures consistency between distances)
layout = nx.kamada_kawai_layout(G)

# Convert the layout to a JSON-compatible format
layout_json = {node: list(position) for node, position in layout.items()}

# Serialize the layout to a JSON string
layout_json_string = json.dumps(layout_json, indent=2)

# Print the JSON layout
print(layout_json_string)
```

### Notes:
1. The `kamada_kawai_layout` algorithm attempts to place nodes such that their Euclidean distances in the layout are proportional to their shortest-path distances in the graph.
2. The output is a JSON string of node positions, with the format `{node: [x, y]}` where `node` is the node ID, and `[x, y]` is the 2D position.
3. The code does not visually draw the graph; it only computes and outputs the layout positions as requested.
