To produce a graph layout that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretical distance, we can use the `spring_layout` algorithm provided by NetworkX. This algorithm simulates a force-directed layout, where nodes repel and edges act as springs to converge into a stable layout.

Here's the Python code to generate the layout and produce the result in JSON format, using NetworkX for layout computation but without drawing the graph. The output is returned as a JSON object containing the node positions.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Graph edges
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), 
    (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), 
    (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), 
    (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22)
]

# Create a graph
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Generate node positions using a spring layout
positions = nx.spring_layout(G)

# Convert positions to a JSON serializable format
positions_json = {str(node): pos.tolist() for node, pos in positions.items()}

# Print the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(positions_json, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
- **Input Data**: The input is an edge list that defines the graph.
- **Graph Construction**: Using NetworkX's `Graph` class, we construct the graph with `add_edges_from`.
- **Spring Layout**: The `spring_layout` function in NetworkX computes a force-directed layout, preserving graph-theoretic distances.
- **JSON Serialization**: Node positions returned by `spring_layout` are converted into a dictionary (`positions_json`) with the node IDs as string keys and their coordinates as lists.
- **Output**: The layout positions are printed in JSON format, which can be saved or used further.

Replace the `<graph data>` in the input with appropriate edge lists to reuse this script for other graphs.
