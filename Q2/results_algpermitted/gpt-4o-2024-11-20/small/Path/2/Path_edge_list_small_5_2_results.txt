Below is the Python code that calculates the layout of the graph based on the edge list provided. The layout ensures consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance using the Kamada-Kawai algorithm, which is designed to achieve this. The output is a JSON representation of the calculated positions.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Edge list of the graph
edge_list = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), 
             (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), 
             (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), 
             (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24)]

# Generate the graph
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Calculate the layout with Kamada-Kawai algorithm
positions = nx.kamada_kawai_layout(G)

# Convert positions to JSON-friendly format
positions_json = {node: {"x": pos[0], "y": pos[1]} for node, pos in positions.items()}

# Print the JSON representation
print(json.dumps(positions_json, indent=4))
``` 

When you run this code, it will output the graph layout in JSON format, with each node represented by its x and y coordinates.
