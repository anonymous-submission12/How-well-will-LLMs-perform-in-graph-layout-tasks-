To generate a layout for a graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a force-directed layout algorithm. An example of such an algorithm is the Fruchterman-Reingold layout, which can be implemented using Python libraries like `networkx`. Below is a Python script that calculates the layout using `networkx` and outputs the positions in JSON format:

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5),
    (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10),
    (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14),
    (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18),
    (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22),
    (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25)
]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Compute the graph layout using Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm
positions = nx.spring_layout(G)

# Convert the positions to JSON format
positions_json = json.dumps(positions)

# Output the positions in JSON format
print(positions_json)
```

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the script:

1. **Import Libraries**: It starts by importing the necessary libraries `networkx` for graph processing and `json` for outputting the layout in JSON format.

2. **Define Edge List**: The graph is defined using an edge list provided by you.

3. **Create Graph**: A graph object `G` is instantiated using `networkx` and edges are added from the edge list.

4. **Compute Layout**: The `spring_layout` function computes positions of nodes using the Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed algorithm which attempts to maintain consistent distances.

5. **Convert and Output JSON**: The node positions are converted into JSON format and printed.

The `spring_layout` function is suitable for preserving the graph-theoretic distance in layout calculations, and the output is directly converted to JSON for further use.
