Below is a Python script that uses the `networkx` library to compute a layout for the provided graph. The script uses the `spring_layout` algorithm, which is designed to minimize edge crossings by simulating a physical system where edges behave like springs. The output is a layout in JSON format.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the graph data as an edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), 
    (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 12), (0, 13), (0, 14), (0, 15), 
    (0, 16), (0, 17), (0, 18), (0, 19), (0, 20), (0, 21), (0, 22), 
    (0, 23), (0, 24), (0, 25)
]

# Create a graph using NetworkX
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Use the spring_layout algorithm to compute the node positions
# This layout minimizes edge crossings and spreads nodes naturally
positions = nx.spring_layout(G)

# Convert positions to JSON format
# Round positions for readability
layout_json = json.dumps({node: [round(pos[0], 4), round(pos[1], 4)] for node, pos in positions.items()}, indent=4)

# Print the JSON-formatted layout
print(layout_json)
```

### How to Interpret the Code:
1. The `spring_layout` is a force-directed graph drawing algorithm that positions nodes in two-dimensional space to minimize overlapping and edge crossings.
2. The node positions output by the above code are in the form of a dictionary where each key is a node, and the value is a 2D-coordinate `[x, y]`.
3. The output is formatted into JSON for easy readability and can be used as input to external tools for visualization, if necessary.

### Execution
Run the script in a Python environment with the `networkx` and `json` libraries installed. The output will look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [0.0, 0.0],
    "1": [0.1234, 0.5678],
    "2": [-0.2345, 0.4567],
    ...
}
``` 

Each key-value pair provides the coordinates for a specific node.
