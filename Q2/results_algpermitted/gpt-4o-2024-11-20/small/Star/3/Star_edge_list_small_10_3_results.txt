Below is a Python script that utilizes the `networkx` library to generate a graph layout. The script uses the Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed algorithm (`spring_layout`), which aims to minimize edge crossings and evenly space graph nodes. The final output of the code is the graph layout in JSON format, where each node is associated with its x and y position.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9),
    (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 12), (0, 13), (0, 14), (0, 15), (0, 16), (0, 17),
    (0, 18), (0, 19), (0, 20), (0, 21), (0, 22), (0, 23), (0, 24), (0, 25),
    (0, 26), (0, 27), (0, 28), (0, 29)
]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Compute the layout using the spring layout algorithm
# Positions will be a dictionary mapping nodes to positions in 2D space
positions = nx.spring_layout(G)

# Convert the positions to a JSON-serializable format
positions_json = {node: {'x': float(pos[0]), 'y': float(pos[1])} for node, pos in positions.items()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(positions_json, indent=4))
```

### Instructions to Run:
1. Install `networkx`: If not already installed, you can install the `networkx` library using the command `pip install networkx`.
2. Run the script: Copy the script into a Python environment and execute it. The output will be a JSON representation of the node positions.

### Notes:
- The `spring_layout` algorithm is well-suited for general graphs and aims to minimize edge crossings by applying a force-directed approach.
- Each node in the resulting JSON is associated with an `(x, y)` position in a coordinate space.
- The script avoids using graphical visualization libraries like `matplotlib` and focuses purely on JSON output.
