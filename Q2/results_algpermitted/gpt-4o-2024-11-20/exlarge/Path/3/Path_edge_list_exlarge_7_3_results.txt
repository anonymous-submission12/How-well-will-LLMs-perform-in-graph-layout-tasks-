Here is the Python code that uses the `networkx` library to generate a layout for your graph and outputs the layout in JSON format. The algorithm used for minimizing edge crossings is the `spring` layout algorithm, which is provided by `networkx` and computes positions that are visually appealing and minimize overlaps.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10),
    (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18),
    (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26),
    (26, 27), (27, 28), (28, 29), (29, 30), (30, 31), (31, 32), (32, 33), (33, 34),
    (34, 35), (35, 36), (36, 37), (37, 38), (38, 39), (39, 40), (40, 41), (41, 42),
    (42, 43), (43, 44), (44, 45), (45, 46), (46, 47), (47, 48), (48, 49), (49, 50),
    (50, 51), (51, 52), (52, 53), (53, 54), (54, 55), (55, 56), (56, 57), (57, 58),
    (58, 59), (59, 60), (60, 61), (61, 62), (62, 63), (63, 64), (64, 65), (65, 66),
    (66, 67), (67, 68), (68, 69), (69, 70), (70, 71), (71, 72), (72, 73), (73, 74),
    (74, 75), (75, 76)
]

# Create a graph object
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Generate a layout using the spring layout algorithm
layout = nx.spring_layout(G)  # Positions stored in a dictionary

# Convert the layout to JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(layout)

# Print the JSON layout
print(layout_json)
```

### How It Works:
1. **Input Graph:** The edge list defines the structure of the graph.
2. **NetworkX Graph:** The `nx.Graph()` object is created and edges are added using the provided edge list.
3. **Spring Layout:** The `spring_layout` algorithm minimizes edge crossings and tries to distribute nodes evenly based on physical simulation principles.
4. **Output Format:** The positions are converted into JSON format where nodes are keys and their positions (x, y coordinates) are values.

### Output:
The final output is a dictionary-like JSON object where each node is has a coordinate pair:

```json
{
  "0": [0.5, -0.1],
  "1": [0.4, 0.2],
  ...
  "76": [0.6, -0.5]
}
```

Feel free to execute this code in a Python environment installed with the `networkx` library to obtain the graph layout in JSON format!
