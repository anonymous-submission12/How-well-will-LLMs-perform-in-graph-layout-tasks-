Here is a Python script that reads the edge_list representation of the graph provided, computes a layout for the graph using a force-directed algorithm to minimize edge crossings, and outputs the layout positions in JSON format. The script uses the `networkx` library for graph representation and the layout algorithm.

```python
import json
import networkx as nx

# Input graph edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), 
    (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), 
    (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), 
    (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26), (26, 27), (27, 28), (28, 29), (29, 30), 
    (30, 31), (31, 32), (32, 33), (33, 34), (34, 35), (35, 36), (36, 37), 
    (37, 38), (38, 39), (39, 40), (40, 41), (41, 42), (42, 43), (43, 44), 
    (44, 45), (45, 46), (46, 47), (47, 48), (48, 49), (49, 50), (50, 51), 
    (51, 52), (52, 53), (53, 54), (54, 55), (55, 56), (56, 57), (57, 58), 
    (58, 59), (59, 60), (60, 61), (61, 62), (62, 63), (63, 64), (64, 65), 
    (65, 66), (66, 67), (67, 68), (68, 69), (69, 70), (70, 71), (71, 72), 
    (72, 73), (73, 74), (74, 75), (75, 76), (76, 77), (77, 78)
]

# Create a graph using NetworkX
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Compute graph layout using the spring layout algorithm (force-directed)
layout = nx.spring_layout(G)

# Convert the layout positions to JSON format
# The positions are stored as node: (x, y) pairs
layout_json = {node: {'x': pos[0], 'y': pos[1]} for node, pos in layout.items()}

# Output the graph layout as JSON
print(json.dumps(layout_json, indent=4))
```

### Instructions to Run the Script:
1. Copy the above code into a Python file.
2. Ensure you have the `networkx` library installed (`pip install networkx`).
3. Run the script to compute and print the layout in JSON format.

### Output Format:
The script outputs a JSON object where each node is associated with a 2D position (`x`, `y`) that minimizes edge crossings. For example:
```json
{
    "0": {"x": 0.0, "y": 0.0},
    "1": {"x": 0.1, "y": 0.2},
    ...
}
```

The layout is computed using the `spring_layout` function from NetworkX, which is a common force-directed layout algorithm suitable for minimizing edge crossings in graphs.
