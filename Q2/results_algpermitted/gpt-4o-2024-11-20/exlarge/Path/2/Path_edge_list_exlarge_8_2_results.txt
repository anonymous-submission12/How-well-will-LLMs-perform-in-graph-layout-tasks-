Below is the Python code that generates a graph layout using an existing layout algorithm while ensuring consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance. The script uses the `networkx` library to compute the graph layout, specifically the `spring_layout` algorithm, which is ideal for maintaining such consistency. The output is the layout in JSON format.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the edge list
edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), 
         (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), 
         (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), 
         (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26), (26, 27), (27, 28), (28, 29), 
         (29, 30), (30, 31), (31, 32), (32, 33), (33, 34), (34, 35), (35, 36), 
         (36, 37), (37, 38), (38, 39), (39, 40), (40, 41), (41, 42), (42, 43), 
         (43, 44), (44, 45), (45, 46), (46, 47), (47, 48), (48, 49), (49, 50), 
         (50, 51), (51, 52), (52, 53), (53, 54), (54, 55), (55, 56), (56, 57), 
         (57, 58), (58, 59), (59, 60), (60, 61), (61, 62), (62, 63), (63, 64), 
         (64, 65), (65, 66), (66, 67), (67, 68), (68, 69), (69, 70), (70, 71), 
         (71, 72), (72, 73), (73, 74), (74, 75), (75, 76), (76, 77)]

# Create the graph using NetworkX
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edges)

# Generate the layout using spring_layout
layout = nx.spring_layout(G)

# Convert layout data to JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps({node: list(pos) for node, pos in layout.items()}, indent=4)

# Print the output layout in JSON format
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Library Selection**: `networkx.spring_layout` is used because it adapts positions of nodes in the graph to minimize overlap and ensures that Euclidean distances between nodes are proportional to the graph-theoretic distances.
2. **Graph Creation**: Edges from the provided edge list are added to a graph object created with `networkx.Graph()`.
3. **Layout Computation**: The `spring_layout` algorithm calculates the positions of nodes based on physical principles of a spring system.
4. **Json Conversion**: The layout is converted into JSON format where node IDs map to their calculated positions as `[x, y]` coordinates.
5. **Output**: The result is printed as JSON, which can be easily consumed by a frontend or visualization tool.
