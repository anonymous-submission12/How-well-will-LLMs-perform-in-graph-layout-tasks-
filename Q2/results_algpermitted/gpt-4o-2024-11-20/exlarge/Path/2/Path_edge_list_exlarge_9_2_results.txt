Below is the Python code to generate a layout for the given graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance. The layout is computed using the Kamada-Kawai layout algorithm provided by the `networkx` library. The result is output in JSON format.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Graph edges list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), 
    (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), 
    (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), 
    (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26), (26, 27), 
    (27, 28), (28, 29), (29, 30), (30, 31), (31, 32), (32, 33), 
    (33, 34), (34, 35), (35, 36), (36, 37), (37, 38), (38, 39), 
    (39, 40), (40, 41), (41, 42), (42, 43), (43, 44), (44, 45), 
    (45, 46), (46, 47), (47, 48), (48, 49), (49, 50), (50, 51), 
    (51, 52), (52, 53), (53, 54), (54, 55), (55, 56), (56, 57), 
    (57, 58), (58, 59), (59, 60), (60, 61), (61, 62), (62, 63), 
    (63, 64), (64, 65), (65, 66), (66, 67), (67, 68), (68, 69), 
    (69, 70), (70, 71), (71, 72), (72, 73), (73, 74), (74, 75), 
    (75, 76), (76, 77), (77, 78)

# Create a graph using networkx
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Generate positions using the Kamada-Kawai layout algorithm
positions = nx.kamada_kawai_layout(G)

# Convert positions to a JSON-friendly format
positions_json = {node: pos.tolist() for node, pos in positions.items()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(positions_json, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created using NetworkX and the `edge_list`.
2. **Layout Algorithm**: The Kamada-Kawai layout algorithm is used. This algorithm ensures the Euclidean distance between nodes in the layout reflects their graph-theoretic distance as closely as possible.
3. **JSON Conversion**: The layout positions are converted into a list format and serialized into JSON.
4. **Output**: The final output is a JSON-formatted dictionary where keys are node IDs and values are their 2D positions (`[x, y]` coordinates). 

You can run this script in a Python environment where NetworkX is installed, and it will output the graph layout in JSON format.
