Here is the Python code to generate a layout for the given graph using an algorithm that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance. We will utilize the `spring_layout` from NetworkX, which applies the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm designed to achieve such consistency. The output will be in JSON format.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Input edge list for the graph
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 9), (0, 12), (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 10), (1, 12),
    (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 12), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 10), (3, 11),
    (3, 12), (5, 7), (5, 11), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 10), (8, 9),
    (8, 11), (8, 62), (10, 11), (13, 14), (13, 17), (13, 19), (13, 21), (13, 22),
    ...
    # More edges as provided (truncated for brevity)
    ...
]

# Create a graph using NetworkX
graph = nx.Graph()
graph.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Generate graph layout using spring_layout
# Spring layout maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance
positions = nx.spring_layout(graph)

# Convert layout to JSON
layout_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Construction**: The edge list is used to construct a graph using NetworkX's `Graph()` class.
2. **Spring Layout**: The `spring_layout` function determines the positions of the nodes such that their relative distances align with the graph-theoretic distances.
3. **Output in JSON**: The node positions (x, y coordinates) are organized in a dictionary where the keys are node IDs and values are their respective coordinate tuples. This dictionary is serialized into JSON format for output.

Replace the `...` in the edge list with the entirety of the edge list provided in your input. The `spring_layout` will compute the positions automatically.

This script provides the graph layout in JSON format without any visual representation.
