Below is the Python code to generate a graph layout while preserving community structures using modularity-based community detection algorithms. This code converts the edge list into a graph, detects communities, assigns a layout preserving the community structure, and outputs the node positions in JSON format.

```python
import json
import networkx as nx
import community  # python-louvain package
import numpy as np

def generate_graph_layout(edge_list):
    # Create the graph from the edge list
    G = nx.Graph()
    G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

    # Detect communities using the Louvain method
    partition = community.best_partition(G)  # Returns a dictionary {node: community_id}

    # Group nodes by their community IDs
    communities = {}
    for node, comm_id in partition.items():
        if comm_id not in communities:
            communities[comm_id] = []
        communities[comm_id].append(node)

    # Generate layout for the whole graph while keeping communities separated
    positions = {}
    community_positions = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)  # Base layout for initial positions
    scale = 10.0  # Scale factor to separate communities

    for comm_id, nodes in communities.items():
        # Extract subgraph for the community
        subgraph = G.subgraph(nodes)
        subgraph_positions = nx.spring_layout(subgraph, seed=42)  # Layout within the community
        # Offset the positions to separate each community
        offset_x, offset_y = np.random.rand(2) * scale
        for node in nodes:
            sub_pos = subgraph_positions[node]
            positions[node] = [
                community_positions[node][0] + offset_x, 
                community_positions[node][1] + offset_y
            ]

    # Output positions as JSON
    return json.dumps(positions)

# Example usage
edge_list = [
    (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 9), (0, 10), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), 
    (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 10), (2, 5), (2, 11), (3, 7),
    (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 11), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 10), (8, 9), (8, 10), 
    (8, 11), (8, 59), (9, 10), (9, 18), (10, 11), (12, 13), (12, 14), 
    (12, 16), (12, 17), (12, 19), (12, 21), (13, 14), (13, 18), (14, 16),
    # Additional edges truncated for brevity -- include all edges provided as required
]

layout_json = generate_graph_layout(edge_list)

# Print the results
print(layout_json)
```

### Requirements
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed in your environment:

1. `networkx` - To represent and process graph structures.
   ```bash
   pip install networkx
   ```

2. `community` - For Louvain method-based community detection (part of `python-louvain` package).
   ```bash
   pip install python-louvain
   ```

The script generates graph node positions split by communities while using the spring layout (preserves inter-node relationships). The generated positions are returned in JSON format.
