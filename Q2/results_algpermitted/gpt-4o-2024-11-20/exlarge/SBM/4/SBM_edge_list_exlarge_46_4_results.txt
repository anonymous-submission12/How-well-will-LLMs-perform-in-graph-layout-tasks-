Below is the Python code to generate a layout for the given graph that highlights its community structure using the Louvain community detection algorithm. This code outputs the layout data in JSON format:

```python
import networkx as nx
from community import community_louvain
import json

# Define the edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 12), (0, 13), (0, 16), (0, 17), (0, 20), (0, 31), (0, 36), 
    (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 10), (1, 14), (1, 16), (1, 18), (1, 21), (1, 23), (1, 24), (1, 25), (1, 49), 
    (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 8), (2, 10), (2, 12), (2, 14), (2, 16), (2, 17), (2, 18), (2, 19), (2, 21),
    # (Remaining edges truncated for brevity - use original edge data provided in the question)
]

# Build the graph
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Detect communities using the Louvain method
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Create community-aware positions
# Nodes in the same community will be located closer to each other
community_positions = {}
for community in set(partition.values()):
    subgraph_nodes = [node for node in partition if partition[node] == community]
    subgraph = G.subgraph(subgraph_nodes)
    subgraph_pos = nx.spring_layout(subgraph)  # Use spring layout (force-directed) for subgraph
    community_positions[community] = subgraph_pos

# Generate the final layout, placing nodes in their respective community positions
final_positions = {}
for community, subgraph_pos in community_positions.items():
    for node, pos in subgraph_pos.items():
        final_positions[node] = pos

# Convert the layout to JSON
final_positions_json = json.dumps(final_positions)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(final_positions_json)
```

### Explanation:

1. **NetworkX Graph Construction**: The edge list is used to construct a graph using NetworkX.
2. **Community Detection**: Communities are detected using the `community_louvain.best_partition` function, which assigns a community to each node.
3. **Layout Generation**: A force-directed layout (`spring_layout`) is computed individually for each community to ensure nodes within a community are closer to each other.
4. **Combine Layouts**: The layouts of all communities are combined into a single dictionary of node positions.
5. **JSON Serialization**: The final layout positions are serialized into JSON format for output.

### Result:
Run the code in a Python environment with the necessary modules (`networkx`, `community`, and `json`) installed. The output will be a JSON-formatted string containing the positions of all nodes, suitable for rendering or storage.
