To process the given graph and create its layout while minimizing edge crossings, we can use Python's `networkx` library. The `kamada_kawai_layout` and `spring_layout` are some of the provided algorithms that attempt to minimize edge crossings and create aesthetically pleasing layouts. Here is the Python code to generate a layout for the graph in JSON format:

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Input edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 10), (0, 14), (0, 15), (0, 17), (0, 19), (1, 4),
    (1, 10), (1, 12), (1, 17), (1, 19), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 10), (2, 13), (2, 14),
    # Additional edges truncated for brevity
    (75, 76), (76, 77)
]

# Create a graph instance using NetworkX
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Generate the layout using a force-based algorithm (e.g., spring layout)
# You can replace spring_layout with kamada_kawai_layout if preferred
layout = nx.spring_layout(G)  # Using Spring layout to minimize edge crossings

# Convert layout to JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps({node: position.tolist() for node, position in layout.items()}, indent=2)

# Print the layout
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation
1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is built using NetworkX's `Graph()` object and initialized with the provided edge list.
   
2. **Layout Algorithm**: The `spring_layout` algorithm is used, which minimizes energy in a force-directed fashion to arrange the nodes. Alternatives like `kamada_kawai_layout` also serve a similar purpose and can be used here.

3. **Result Conversion**: The positions of nodes, output as a dictionary, are converted to a JSON format for easy export.
   
4. **Output**: The node positions are in JSON format, where each node corresponds to a 2D coordinate `[x, y]`.

You can run the script and observe the computed graph layout as JSON. If needed, switch between algorithms to experiment with the output.
