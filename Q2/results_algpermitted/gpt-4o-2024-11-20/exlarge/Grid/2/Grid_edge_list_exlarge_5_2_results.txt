Below is a Python script to generate a consistent graph layout between Euclidean distances and graph-theoretic distances. The script uses the `networkx` library for graph representation and the `spring_layout` algorithm, which ensures that the Euclidean distances approximate the graph-theoretic distances.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the graph edges as an edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 12), (1, 2), (1, 13), (2, 3), (2, 14), (3, 4), (3, 15), (4, 5), (4, 16),
             (5, 6), (5, 17), (6, 7), (6, 18), (7, 8), (7, 19), (8, 9), (8, 20), (9, 10), (9, 21),
             (10, 11), (10, 22), (11, 23), (12, 13), (12, 24), (13, 14), (13, 25), (14, 15), (14, 26),
             (15, 16), (15, 27), (16, 17), (16, 28), (17, 18), (17, 29), (18, 19), (18, 30), (19, 20),
             (19, 31), (20, 21), (20, 32), (21, 22), (21, 33), (22, 23), (22, 34), (23, 35), (24, 25),
             (24, 36), (25, 26), (25, 37), (26, 27), (26, 38), (27, 28), (27, 39), (28, 29), (28, 40),
             (29, 30), (29, 41), (30, 31), (30, 42), (31, 32), (31, 43), (32, 33), (32, 44), (33, 34),
             (33, 45), (34, 35), (34, 46), (35, 47), (36, 37), (36, 48), (37, 38), (37, 49), (38, 39),
             (38, 50), (39, 40), (39, 51), (40, 41), (40, 52), (41, 42), (41, 53), (42, 43), (42, 54),
             (43, 44), (43, 55), (44, 45), (44, 56), (45, 46), (45, 57), (46, 47), (46, 58), (47, 59),
             (48, 49), (48, 60), (49, 50), (49, 61), (50, 51), (50, 62), (51, 52), (51, 63), (52, 53),
             (52, 64), (53, 54), (53, 65), (54, 55), (54, 66), (55, 56), (55, 67), (56, 57), (56, 68),
             (57, 58), (57, 69), (58, 59), (58, 70), (59, 71), (60, 61), (61, 62), (62, 63), (63, 64),
             (64, 65), (65, 66), (66, 67), (67, 68), (68, 69), (69, 70), (70, 71)]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Generate the graph layout using the spring layout algorithm
# Spring layout attempts to position nodes such that the Euclidean distances approximate graph-theoretic distances.
positions = nx.spring_layout(G)

# Convert the positions into a dictionary format
layout_json = {node: {"x": pos[0], "y": pos[1]} for node, pos in positions.items()}

# Output the layout as a JSON string
print(json.dumps(layout_json, indent=4))
```

### Explanation of the code:
1. The **`edge_list`** is provided as input.
2. A graph (**`G`**) is created using **NetworkX's `Graph`** class.
3. **`spring_layout`** is used as it ensures a consistent approximation between Euclidean and graph-theoretic distances.
4. The positions of nodes are formatted into JSON, where each node has `x` and `y` coordinates.
5. Finally, the layout is output in JSON format.

When you run the script, it provides a JSON object describing the graph's layout. Let me know if you need further help!
