To generate a layout for the graph that minimizes edge crossings, we can use the `networkx` library to create the graph and then apply a layout algorithm such as the Kamada-Kawai layout, which is designed to minimize edge crossings and produce aesthetically pleasing layouts. The positions of the nodes will then be exported in JSON format.

Here is the Python script to achieve this:

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the graph using the provided edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 11), (1, 2), (1, 12), (2, 3), (2, 13), (3, 4), (3, 14), 
             (4, 5), (4, 15), (5, 6), (5, 16), (6, 7), (6, 17), (7, 8), (7, 18), 
             (8, 9), (8, 19), (9, 10), (9, 20), (10, 21), (11, 12), (12, 13), 
             (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), 
             (20, 21)]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Generate the layout using the Kamada-Kawai algorithm
pos = nx.kamada_kawai_layout(G)

# Convert the positions to a dictionary with node IDs as keys and positions as values
layout = {node: [float(pos[node][0]), float(pos[node][1])] for node in pos}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created using the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Generation**: The Kamada-Kawai layout algorithm is used to generate positions for the nodes. This algorithm attempts to minimize edge crossings and produce a visually appealing layout.
3. **JSON Output**: The positions of the nodes are converted to a dictionary and then serialized to JSON format.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node ID, and the value is a list containing the x and y coordinates of the node's position.

You can run this script in a Python environment to get the JSON output.
