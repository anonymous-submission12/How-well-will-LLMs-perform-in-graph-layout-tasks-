To generate a layout for the graph that minimizes edge crossings, we can use the `networkx` library to create the graph and then apply a layout algorithm such as the Kamada-Kawai layout or the Fruchterman-Reingold layout. These algorithms are designed to minimize edge crossings and produce aesthetically pleasing layouts.

Here is the Python code that generates the layout and outputs it in JSON format:

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the graph using the provided edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 8), (4, 9),
    (5, 6), (5, 10), (6, 7), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 12), (8, 9), (8, 13),
    (9, 14), (10, 11), (10, 15), (11, 12), (11, 16), (12, 13), (12, 17),
    (13, 14), (13, 18), (14, 19), (15, 16), (15, 20), (16, 17), (16, 21),
    (17, 18), (17, 22), (18, 19), (18, 23), (19, 24), (20, 21), (21, 22),
    (22, 23), (23, 24)
]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Generate the layout using the Kamada-Kawai algorithm
layout = nx.kamada_kawai_layout(G)

# Convert the layout to a dictionary with node IDs as keys and positions as values
layout_dict = {node: [float(pos[0]), float(pos[1])] for node, pos in layout.items()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout_dict, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created using the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Generation**: The `kamada_kawai_layout` function from `networkx` is used to generate the layout. This algorithm attempts to minimize edge crossings and produce a visually pleasing layout.
3. **JSON Output**: The layout is converted to a dictionary where each node is mapped to its position, and then the dictionary is serialized to JSON format.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node ID, and the value is a list containing the x and y coordinates of the node's position in the layout.

```json
{
    "0": [0.0, 0.0],
    "1": [0.5, 0.5],
    "2": [1.0, 1.0],
    ...
    "24": [4.0, 4.0]
}
```

This JSON can be used to visualize the graph in any plotting library or for further processing.
