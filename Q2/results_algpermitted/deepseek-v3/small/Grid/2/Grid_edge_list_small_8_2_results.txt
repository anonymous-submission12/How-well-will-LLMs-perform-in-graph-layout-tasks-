To generate a graph layout that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use the `networkx` library to compute the layout and then export the positions in JSON format. Specifically, we can use the `spring_layout` algorithm, which is designed to position nodes in such a way that the Euclidean distance between nodes approximates their graph-theoretic distance.

Here is the Python script to achieve this:

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the graph using the provided edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 14), (1, 2), (1, 15), (2, 3), (2, 16), (3, 4), (3, 17), 
    (4, 5), (4, 18), (5, 6), (5, 19), (6, 7), (6, 20), (7, 8), (7, 21), 
    (8, 9), (8, 22), (9, 10), (9, 23), (10, 11), (10, 24), (11, 12), 
    (11, 25), (12, 13), (12, 26), (13, 27), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), 
    (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), 
    (24, 25), (25, 26), (26, 27)
]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Compute the layout using the spring layout algorithm
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, k=0.15, iterations=50)

# Convert the positions to a dictionary with node IDs as keys and positions as values
layout = {node: [float(pos[node][0]), float(pos[node][1])] for node in G.nodes()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created using the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Calculation**: The `spring_layout` algorithm is used to compute the positions of the nodes. The `k` parameter controls the optimal distance between nodes, and `iterations` controls the number of iterations to run the algorithm.
3. **JSON Output**: The positions are converted to a dictionary where each node ID maps to its position in 2D space. This dictionary is then serialized to JSON format.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node ID, and the value is a list of two floats representing the x and y coordinates of the node's position.

```json
{
    "0": [0.123, 0.456],
    "1": [0.234, 0.567],
    ...
    "27": [0.789, 0.890]
}
```

This JSON can be used to visualize the graph or for further processing.
