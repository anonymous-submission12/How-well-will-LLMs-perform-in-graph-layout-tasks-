To generate a graph layout that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use the `networkx` library to compute the layout and then output the positions in JSON format. Specifically, we can use the `spring_layout` algorithm, which is designed to position nodes in such a way that the Euclidean distance between nodes approximates their graph-theoretic distance.

Here is the Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the graph using the provided edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 10), (1, 2), (1, 11), (2, 3), (2, 12), (3, 4), (3, 13), 
    (4, 5), (4, 14), (5, 6), (5, 15), (6, 7), (6, 16), (7, 8), (7, 17), 
    (8, 9), (8, 18), (9, 19), (10, 11), (10, 20), (11, 12), (11, 21), 
    (12, 13), (12, 22), (13, 14), (13, 23), (14, 15), (14, 24), (15, 16), 
    (15, 25), (16, 17), (16, 26), (17, 18), (17, 27), (18, 19), (18, 28), 
    (19, 29), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26), 
    (26, 27), (27, 28), (28, 29)
]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Compute the layout using the spring layout algorithm
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, k=0.15, iterations=50)

# Convert the positions to a dictionary with node IDs as keys and positions as values
layout = {node: list(coords) for node, coords in pos.items()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created using the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Calculation**: The `spring_layout` algorithm is used to compute the positions of the nodes. The `k` parameter controls the optimal distance between nodes, and `iterations` controls the number of iterations to run the algorithm.
3. **JSON Output**: The positions are converted to a dictionary where the keys are node IDs and the values are their corresponding coordinates. This dictionary is then serialized to JSON format.

### Output:
The script will output the graph layout in JSON format, where each node is mapped to its 2D coordinates. For example:

```json
{
    "0": [0.123, 0.456],
    "1": [0.234, 0.567],
    ...
    "29": [0.987, 0.654]
}
```

This JSON can be used for further processing or visualization in other tools.
