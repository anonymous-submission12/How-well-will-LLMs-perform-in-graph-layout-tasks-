To generate a graph layout that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use the `networkx` library to create the graph and compute the layout using the `spring_layout` algorithm, which is designed to minimize the difference between Euclidean and graph-theoretic distances. The final layout will be output in JSON format.

Here is the Python script to achieve this:

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the graph using the provided edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 11), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), 
    (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), 
    (2, 10), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), (3, 11), (4, 6), 
    (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (5, 10), (6, 7), 
    (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (8, 9), (8, 10), 
    (8, 11), (9, 11), (9, 22), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17), (12, 18), 
    (12, 19), (12, 20), (12, 21), (12, 22), (12, 23), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 16), 
    (13, 18), (13, 19), (13, 20), (13, 22), (13, 23), (14, 15), (14, 17), (14, 18), 
    (14, 19), (14, 20), (14, 22), (14, 23), (15, 16), (15, 17), (15, 18), (15, 19), 
    (15, 22), (15, 23), (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 19), (16, 22), (16, 23), (17, 19), 
    (17, 20), (17, 21), (17, 22), (17, 23), (18, 20), (18, 21), (18, 23), (19, 21), 
    (19, 23), (20, 21), (20, 22), (21, 22), (21, 23)
]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Compute the layout using the spring layout algorithm
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, k=0.15, iterations=50)

# Convert the layout to a dictionary with node IDs as keys and positions as values
layout = {node: [float(pos[node][0]), float(pos[node][1])] for node in G.nodes()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created using the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Calculation**: The `spring_layout` algorithm is used to compute the positions of the nodes. The `k` parameter controls the optimal distance between nodes, and `iterations` controls the number of iterations to run the algorithm.
3. **JSON Output**: The positions of the nodes are converted to a dictionary and then output in JSON format.

This script will output the graph layout in JSON format, which you can use for further processing or visualization.
