To generate a graph layout that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use the `networkx` library to create the graph and compute the layout using the `spring_layout` algorithm, which is based on the Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed algorithm. This algorithm attempts to position nodes such that the Euclidean distance between nodes reflects their graph-theoretic distance.

Here is the Python code to generate the layout and output it in JSON format:

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the graph using the provided edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 15),
    (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10),
    (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10),
    (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), (3, 11),
    (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 11),
    (5, 7), (5, 9), (5, 10),
    (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 11),
    (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 23),
    (8, 9), (8, 10),
    (9, 10), (9, 11),
    (10, 11),
    (12, 14), (12, 16), (12, 18), (12, 19), (12, 21), (12, 22), (12, 23),
    (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (13, 18), (13, 19), (13, 20), (13, 23),
    (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (14, 20), (14, 22), (14, 23),
    (15, 18), (15, 19), (15, 20), (15, 21), (15, 23),
    (16, 18), (16, 19), (16, 20), (16, 22),
    (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 20), (17, 21), (17, 22), (17, 23),
    (18, 19), (18, 20), (18, 22),
    (19, 20), (19, 21), (19, 22), (19, 23),
    (20, 21), (20, 22), (20, 23),
    (21, 23),
    (22, 23)
]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Generate the layout using the spring layout algorithm
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, k=0.15, iterations=50)

# Convert the layout to a dictionary with node IDs as keys and positions as values
layout = {node: [float(pos[node][0]), float(pos[node][1])] for node in G.nodes()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created using the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Generation**: The `spring_layout` function is used to generate the layout. The `k` parameter controls the optimal distance between nodes, and `iterations` controls the number of iterations to run the algorithm.
3. **JSON Output**: The layout is converted to a dictionary where each node is mapped to its position, and then the dictionary is serialized to JSON format.

This script will output the graph layout in JSON format, which you can use for further processing or visualization.
