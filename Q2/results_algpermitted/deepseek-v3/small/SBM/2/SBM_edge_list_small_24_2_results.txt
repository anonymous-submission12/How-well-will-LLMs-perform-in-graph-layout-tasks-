To generate a graph layout that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use the `networkx` library to compute the layout and then output the positions in JSON format. We'll use the `spring_layout` algorithm, which is designed to position nodes in such a way that the Euclidean distance between nodes approximates their graph-theoretic distance.

Here's the Python script to achieve this:

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the graph using the provided edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 22), 
    (5, 14), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 10), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (9, 10), 
    (9, 11), (10, 11), (10, 26), (12, 13), (12, 16), (12, 17), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (13, 25), 
    (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 19), (15, 16), (15, 17), (16, 17), (18, 19), (18, 20), (18, 21), 
    (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 21), (20, 21), (20, 22), (21, 22), (23, 24), (23, 25), (23, 26), (23, 27), 
    (24, 26), (24, 27), (25, 26), (25, 27), (26, 27)
]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Compute the layout using the spring layout algorithm
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, k=0.15, iterations=50)

# Convert the positions to a dictionary with node IDs as keys and positions as values
layout = {node: [float(pos[node][0]), float(pos[node][1])] for node in G.nodes()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created using the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Calculation**: The `spring_layout` algorithm is used to compute the positions of the nodes. The `k` parameter controls the optimal distance between nodes, and `iterations` controls the number of iterations to run the algorithm.
3. **JSON Output**: The positions are converted to a dictionary where each node ID maps to its position. This dictionary is then serialized to JSON format.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node ID, and the value is a list of two floats representing the x and y coordinates of the node's position.

You can run this script in a Python environment to generate the layout. The output will be printed in JSON format, which you can then use as needed.
