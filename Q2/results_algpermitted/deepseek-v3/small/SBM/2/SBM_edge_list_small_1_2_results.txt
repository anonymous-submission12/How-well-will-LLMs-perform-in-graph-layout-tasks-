To generate a graph layout that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use the `networkx` library to create the graph and compute the layout using the `spring_layout` algorithm, which is designed to minimize the difference between Euclidean and graph-theoretic distances. The final layout will be output in JSON format.

Here is the Python script:

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the graph using the provided edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 14), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (9, 10), (11, 12), (11, 13), (11, 14), (11, 15), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 15), (13, 15), (14, 15), (15, 17), (16, 18), (16, 19), (16, 20), (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 20), (18, 19), (18, 20), (19, 20)]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Compute the layout using the spring layout algorithm
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)  # seed for reproducibility

# Convert the layout to a dictionary with node IDs as keys and positions as values
layout = {node: [float(pos[node][0]), float(pos[node][1])] for node in G.nodes()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created using the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Calculation**: The `spring_layout` algorithm is used to compute the positions of the nodes. This algorithm tries to position nodes such that the Euclidean distance between nodes approximates their graph-theoretic distance.
3. **JSON Output**: The positions are converted to a dictionary and then output in JSON format.

### Output:
The script will output the graph layout in JSON format, where each node is mapped to its 2D coordinates. For example:

```json
{
    "0": [0.123, 0.456],
    "1": [0.234, 0.567],
    ...
}
```

This JSON can be used for further processing or visualization in other tools.
