To generate a graph layout that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use the `networkx` library to compute the layout and then output the positions in JSON format. Specifically, we can use the `spring_layout` algorithm, which is designed to position nodes in such a way that the Euclidean distance between nodes approximates their graph-theoretic distance.

Here is the Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the graph using the provided edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 11), 
             (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 10), (3, 17), (4, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), 
             (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 11), (8, 9), (8, 10), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 14), 
             (11, 15), (12, 13), (12, 15), (12, 16), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 16), 
             (14, 15), (14, 16), (15, 16), (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 20), (17, 21), 
             (18, 19), (18, 20), (20, 21)]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Compute the layout using the spring layout algorithm
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, k=0.15, iterations=50)

# Convert the positions to a dictionary with node IDs as keys and positions as values
layout = {node: [float(pos[node][0]), float(pos[node][1])] for node in G.nodes()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created using the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Calculation**: The `spring_layout` algorithm is used to compute the positions of the nodes. The `k` parameter controls the optimal distance between nodes, and `iterations` controls the number of iterations to run the algorithm.
3. **Position Formatting**: The positions are converted into a dictionary where each node ID maps to its 2D coordinates.
4. **JSON Output**: The dictionary is then converted to a JSON string and printed.

This script will output the graph layout in JSON format, which you can use for further processing or visualization.
