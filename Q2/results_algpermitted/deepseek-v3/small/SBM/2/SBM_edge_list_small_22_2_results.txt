To generate a graph layout that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use the `networkx` library to compute the layout and then output the positions in JSON format. Specifically, we can use the `spring_layout` algorithm, which is designed to position nodes in such a way that the Euclidean distance between nodes approximates their graph-theoretic distance.

Here is the Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the graph using the provided edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 11), 
             (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 11), (6, 13), (7, 10), (7, 11), 
             (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), (12, 13), 
             (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17), (13, 15), (13, 17), (13, 25), 
             (14, 15), (14, 17), (15, 16), (15, 17), (15, 22), (16, 17), 
             (18, 19), (18, 21), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 21), (20, 22), 
             (23, 24), (23, 25), (23, 26), (23, 27), (24, 25), (24, 26), 
             (24, 27), (25, 26), (25, 27), (26, 27)]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Compute the layout using the spring layout algorithm
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)  # seed for reproducibility

# Convert the positions to a dictionary with node IDs as keys and positions as values
layout = {node: [float(pos[node][0]), float(pos[node][1])] for node in G.nodes()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created using the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Calculation**: The `spring_layout` algorithm is used to compute the positions of the nodes. The `seed` parameter ensures that the layout is reproducible.
3. **Position Formatting**: The positions are converted into a dictionary where each node ID maps to its 2D coordinates.
4. **JSON Output**: The dictionary is then converted to a JSON string and printed.

This script will output the graph layout in JSON format, which you can use for further processing or visualization in other tools.
