To generate a layout for the graph that minimizes edge crossings, we can use the `networkx` library to compute the layout and then output the positions in JSON format. We'll use the `spring_layout` algorithm, which is a force-directed layout that tends to minimize edge crossings.

Here's the Python script to achieve this:

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the graph using the provided edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 12),
    (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9), (1, 11), (1, 12),
    (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 9), (2, 11), (2, 12),
    (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), (3, 12),
    (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 11), (4, 12), (4, 24),
    (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 9), (5, 10), (5, 11), (5, 12), (5, 24),
    (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 17),
    (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 11), (7, 12),
    (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (8, 12),
    (9, 11), (10, 12),
    (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 20), (13, 21), (13, 22), (13, 23), (13, 25),
    (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (14, 20), (14, 21), (14, 22), (14, 23), (14, 24), (14, 25),
    (15, 16), (15, 17), (15, 18), (15, 19), (15, 20), (15, 21), (15, 22), (15, 24), (15, 25),
    (16, 19), (16, 20), (16, 21), (16, 22), (16, 24), (16, 25),
    (17, 18), (17, 21), (17, 22), (17, 24), (17, 25),
    (18, 19), (18, 21), (18, 22), (18, 24), (18, 25),
    (19, 20), (19, 21), (19, 23), (19, 24), (19, 25),
    (20, 21), (20, 22), (20, 24), (20, 25),
    (21, 22), (21, 23), (21, 24), (21, 25),
    (22, 23), (22, 24), (22, 25),
    (23, 24), (23, 25),
    (24, 25)
]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Compute the layout using the spring layout algorithm
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)  # seed for reproducibility

# Convert the positions to a dictionary with node IDs as keys and positions as values
layout = {node: [float(pos[node][0]), float(pos[node][1])] for node in G.nodes()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created using the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Calculation**: The `spring_layout` algorithm is used to compute the positions of the nodes. The `seed` parameter ensures reproducibility.
3. **JSON Output**: The positions are converted to a dictionary where each node ID maps to its position. This dictionary is then output in JSON format.

### Output:
The script will output the graph layout in JSON format, where each node is associated with its 2D position. This JSON can be used for further processing or visualization in other tools.
