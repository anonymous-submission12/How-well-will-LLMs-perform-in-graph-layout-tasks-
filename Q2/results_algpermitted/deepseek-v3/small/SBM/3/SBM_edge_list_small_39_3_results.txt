To generate a layout for the graph that minimizes edge crossings, we can use the `graphviz` library, which provides a variety of layout algorithms. Specifically, we can use the `dot` layout algorithm, which is designed to minimize edge crossings in hierarchical graphs.

Below is the Python code that generates the layout for the provided graph and outputs the positions in JSON format:

```python
import json
import graphviz

# Define the graph using the provided edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 12),
    (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (1, 11),
    (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10),
    (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 10),
    (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 9),
    (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 9), (5, 11),
    (6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 11),
    (7, 9), (7, 11),
    (8, 9), (8, 11),
    (9, 10), (9, 11),
    (10, 11), (10, 12),
    (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17), (12, 18), (12, 19), (12, 20), (12, 22),
    (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (13, 18), (13, 20), (13, 21),
    (14, 15), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (14, 20), (14, 22),
    (15, 17), (15, 18), (15, 19), (15, 20), (15, 21), (15, 22),
    (16, 18), (16, 20), (16, 21), (16, 22),
    (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 22),
    (18, 19), (18, 20), (18, 21), (18, 22),
    (19, 22),
    (20, 22),
    (21, 22)
]

# Create a Graphviz graph
dot = graphviz.Graph()

# Add nodes and edges to the graph
for edge in edge_list:
    dot.edge(str(edge[0]), str(edge[1]))

# Use the 'dot' layout algorithm to generate positions
dot.layout(prog='dot')

# Extract the positions from the graph
positions = {}
for node in dot.body:
    if node.startswith('\t'):
        node_id = node.split(' ')[0].strip('"')
        pos = node.split('pos="')[1].split('"')[0]
        x, y = map(float, pos.split(','))
        positions[int(node_id)] = {'x': x, 'y': y}

# Output the positions in JSON format
print(json.dumps(positions, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created using the `graphviz.Graph()` object, and edges are added based on the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Algorithm**: The `dot` layout algorithm is used to generate the positions of the nodes. This algorithm is designed to minimize edge crossings in hierarchical graphs.
3. **Position Extraction**: The positions of the nodes are extracted from the graph's body and stored in a dictionary.
4. **JSON Output**: The positions are output in JSON format.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where the keys are node IDs, and the values are dictionaries containing the `x` and `y` coordinates of each node.

```json
{
    "0": {
        "x": 0.0,
        "y": 0.0
    },
    "1": {
        "x": 1.0,
        "y": 1.0
    },
    ...
}
```

This JSON can be used to visualize the graph using any plotting library or for further processing.
