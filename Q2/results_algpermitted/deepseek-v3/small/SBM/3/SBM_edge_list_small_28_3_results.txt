To generate a layout for the graph that minimizes edge crossings, we can use the `networkx` library to create the graph and then apply a layout algorithm such as the Kamada-Kawai layout, which is designed to minimize edge crossings. The final output will be the positions of the nodes in JSON format.

Here is the Python script:

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 11), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10),
    (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10),
    (3, 11), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (5, 10), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9),
    (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (9, 11), (9, 22), (12, 13), (12, 14),
    (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17), (12, 18), (12, 19), (12, 20), (12, 21), (12, 22), (12, 23), (13, 14), (13, 15),
    (13, 16), (13, 18), (13, 19), (13, 20), (13, 22), (13, 23), (14, 15), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (14, 20),
    (14, 22), (14, 23), (15, 16), (15, 17), (15, 18), (15, 19), (15, 22), (15, 23), (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 19),
    (16, 22), (16, 23), (17, 19), (17, 20), (17, 21), (17, 22), (17, 23), (18, 20), (18, 21), (18, 23), (19, 21),
    (19, 23), (20, 21), (20, 22), (21, 22), (21, 23)
]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Generate the layout using the Kamada-Kawai algorithm
pos = nx.kamada_kawai_layout(G)

# Convert the positions to a dictionary with node IDs as keys and positions as values
layout = {node: [float(pos[node][0]), float(pos[node][1])] for node in pos}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created using the `networkx.Graph()` constructor, and edges are added using `add_edges_from()`.
2. **Layout Generation**: The Kamada-Kawai layout algorithm is applied using `nx.kamada_kawai_layout()`. This algorithm attempts to position nodes in such a way that the graph is visually pleasing and minimizes edge crossings.
3. **JSON Output**: The positions of the nodes are converted to a dictionary and then serialized to JSON format using `json.dumps()`.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node ID, and the value is a list of two floats representing the x and y coordinates of the node's position.

```json
{
    "0": [0.123, 0.456],
    "1": [0.234, 0.567],
    ...
}
```

This JSON can be used to visualize the graph in any tool that supports JSON-based graph layouts.
