To generate a layout for the graph that minimizes edge crossings, we can use the `networkx` library to create the graph and then apply a layout algorithm such as the Kamada-Kawai layout or the Fruchterman-Reingold layout. These algorithms are designed to minimize edge crossings and produce aesthetically pleasing layouts.

Here is the Python code to generate the layout and output it in JSON format:

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the graph using the provided edge list
edge_list = [(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 17), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 7), 
             (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), 
             (3, 7), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 17), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), 
             (6, 19), (8, 9), (8, 13), (8, 15), (9, 10), (9, 12), (9, 13), 
             (9, 14), (9, 16), (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 13), (10, 15), 
             (11, 12), (11, 13), (11, 14), (11, 15), (12, 13), (12, 14), 
             (13, 14), (13, 15), (14, 15), (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 19), 
             (16, 20), (16, 21), (16, 22), (17, 19), (17, 20), (17, 21), 
             (17, 22), (18, 19), (18, 22), (19, 20), (20, 21)]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Generate the layout using the Kamada-Kawai algorithm
layout = nx.kamada_kawai_layout(G)

# Convert the layout to a dictionary with node IDs as keys and positions as values
layout_dict = {node: [float(pos[0]), float(pos[1])] for node, pos in layout.items()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(layout_dict, indent=4)
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created using the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Generation**: The `kamada_kawai_layout` function from `networkx` is used to generate the layout. This algorithm attempts to minimize edge crossings and produce a visually pleasing layout.
3. **JSON Conversion**: The layout is converted to a dictionary where each node is mapped to its position. This dictionary is then converted to a JSON string.
4. **Output**: The JSON string is printed, which contains the positions of all nodes in the graph.

You can run this script to get the layout in JSON format. The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node ID, and the value is a list of two floats representing the x and y coordinates of the node's position.
