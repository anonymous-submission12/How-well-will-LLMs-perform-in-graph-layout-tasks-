To generate a layout for the graph that minimizes edge crossings, we can use the `networkx` library to create the graph and then apply a layout algorithm such as the Kamada-Kawai layout or the Fruchterman-Reingold layout. These algorithms are designed to minimize edge crossings and produce aesthetically pleasing layouts.

Here is the Python code that generates the layout and outputs it in JSON format:

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the graph using the provided edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 15),
    (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10),
    (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10),
    (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), (3, 11),
    (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 11),
    (5, 7), (5, 9), (5, 10),
    (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 11),
    (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 23),
    (8, 9), (8, 10),
    (9, 10), (9, 11),
    (10, 11),
    (12, 14), (12, 16), (12, 18), (12, 19), (12, 21), (12, 22), (12, 23),
    (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (13, 18), (13, 19), (13, 20), (13, 23),
    (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (14, 20), (14, 22), (14, 23),
    (15, 18), (15, 19), (15, 20), (15, 21), (15, 23),
    (16, 18), (16, 19), (16, 20), (16, 22),
    (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 20), (17, 21), (17, 22), (17, 23),
    (18, 19), (18, 20), (18, 22),
    (19, 20), (19, 21), (19, 22), (19, 23),
    (20, 21), (20, 22), (20, 23),
    (21, 23),
    (22, 23)
]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Generate the layout using the Kamada-Kawai algorithm
pos = nx.kamada_kawai_layout(G)

# Convert the layout to a dictionary with node IDs as keys and positions as values
layout = {node: {"x": pos[node][0], "y": pos[node][1]} for node in G.nodes()

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created using the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Generation**: The `kamada_kawai_layout` function from `networkx` is used to generate the layout. This algorithm attempts to minimize edge crossings and produce a visually appealing layout.
3. **JSON Output**: The layout is converted to a dictionary where each node is mapped to its position, and then the dictionary is output in JSON format.

This script will output the positions of the nodes in JSON format, which can be used for further processing or visualization.
