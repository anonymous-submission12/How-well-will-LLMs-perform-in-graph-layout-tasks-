To generate a layout for the graph that keeps the community structure clear, we can use the `networkx` library to handle the graph and community detection, and the `community` library (python-louvain) to detect communities. We will then use a force-directed layout algorithm (like Fruchterman-Reingold) to position the nodes, ensuring that nodes within the same community are placed closer together.

Here is the Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import json

# Input edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 16), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9), 
              (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 11), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 27), (5, 16), (6, 7), (6, 8), 
              (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), 
              (9, 10), (9, 11), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 16), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 17), 
              (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (15, 16), (15, 17), (16, 17), (16, 19), (18, 19), 
              (18, 21), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 22), (20, 21), (20, 22), (23, 27), (24, 26), 
              (24, 27), (25, 26), (25, 27), (26, 27)]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Detect communities using the Louvain method
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Create a dictionary to store the positions of the nodes
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)  # Use a fixed seed for reproducibility

# Adjust the positions to keep communities together
for node in G.nodes():
    community = partition[node]
    pos[node][0] += community * 2  # Shift x-coordinate based on community
    pos[node][1] += community * 2  # Shift y-coordinate based on community

# Convert the positions to a JSON-compatible format
layout = {str(node): {"x": float(pos[node][0]), "y": float(pos[node][1])} for node in G.nodes()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created from the provided edge list.
2. **Community Detection**: The Louvain method is used to detect communities in the graph.
3. **Layout Generation**: The `spring_layout` algorithm is used to generate initial positions for the nodes. The positions are then adjusted based on the community each node belongs to, ensuring that nodes within the same community are placed closer together.
4. **JSON Output**: The final node positions are converted to a JSON-compatible format and printed.

This script will output the graph layout in JSON format, which can be used for further processing or visualization.
