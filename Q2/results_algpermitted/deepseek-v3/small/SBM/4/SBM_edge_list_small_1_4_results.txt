To generate a layout for the graph that keeps the community structure clear, we can use the `networkx` library to handle the graph and community detection, and the `community` library (python-louvain) to detect communities. We will then use the `spring_layout` algorithm to generate positions for the nodes, but we will adjust the positions based on the communities to ensure that nodes within the same community are closer together.

Here is the Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import json

# Define the graph using the edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 14), 
             (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (9, 10), 
             (11, 12), (11, 13), (11, 14), (11, 15), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 15), (13, 15), (14, 15), 
             (15, 17), (16, 18), (16, 19), (16, 20), (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 20), (18, 19), (18, 20), (19, 20)]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Detect communities using the Louvain method
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Generate a layout using the spring layout algorithm
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)

# Adjust positions based on communities
community_pos = {}
for node, community in partition.items():
    if community not in community_pos:
        community_pos[community] = []
    community_pos[community].append(node)

# Calculate the center of each community
community_centers = {}
for community, nodes in community_pos.items():
    x_coords = [pos[node][0] for node in nodes]
    y_coords = [pos[node][1] for node in nodes]
    center_x = sum(x_coords) / len(nodes)
    center_y = sum(y_coords) / len(nodes)
    community_centers[community] = (center_x, center_y)

# Adjust node positions to be closer to their community center
for node, (x, y) in pos.items():
    community = partition[node]
    center_x, center_y = community_centers[community]
    pos[node] = (x + (center_x - x) * 0.5, y + (center_y - y) * 0.5)

# Convert the positions to a JSON-compatible format
layout = {str(node): {"x": float(x), "y": float(y)} for node, (x, y) in pos.items()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created from the provided edge list.
2. **Community Detection**: The Louvain method is used to detect communities in the graph.
3. **Layout Generation**: The `spring_layout` algorithm is used to generate initial positions for the nodes.
4. **Community-Based Adjustment**: The positions of nodes are adjusted to be closer to the center of their respective communities.
5. **JSON Output**: The final layout is converted to a JSON format, where each node is associated with its `x` and `y` coordinates.

This script will output the graph layout in JSON format, which can be used for further visualization or analysis.
