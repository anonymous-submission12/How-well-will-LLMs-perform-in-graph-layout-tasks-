To generate a layout for the graph that keeps the community structure clear, we can use the `networkx` library to handle the graph and community detection, and the `community` library (python-louvain) to detect communities. We will then use a force-directed layout algorithm (like Fruchterman-Reingold) to position the nodes, ensuring that nodes within the same community are placed closer together.

Here is the Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import json

# Define the graph using the edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 22), (5, 14), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 10), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), (10, 26), (12, 13), (12, 16), (12, 17), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (13, 25), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 19), (15, 16), (15, 17), (16, 17), (18, 19), (18, 20), (18, 21), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 21), (20, 21), (20, 22), (21, 22), (23, 24), (23, 25), (23, 26), (23, 27), (24, 26), (24, 27), (25, 26), (25, 27), (26, 27)]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Detect communities using the Louvain method
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Create a layout that respects the community structure
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, weight=None, scale=1, center=(0, 0), k=None, iterations=50, seed=42)

# Adjust positions to keep communities together
for node in G.nodes():
    pos[node][0] += partition[node] * 2  # Shift x-coordinate based on community
    pos[node][1] += partition[node] * 2  # Shift y-coordinate based on community

# Convert the positions to a dictionary with node IDs as keys
layout = {node: {"x": pos[node][0], "y": pos[node][1]} for node in G.nodes()

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created from the provided edge list.
2. **Community Detection**: The Louvain method is used to detect communities in the graph.
3. **Layout Generation**: A force-directed layout (Fruchterman-Reingold) is generated using `nx.spring_layout`. The positions of nodes are then adjusted based on their community to ensure that nodes within the same community are placed closer together.
4. **Output**: The final layout is converted to a JSON format where each node is associated with its `x` and `y` coordinates.

This script will output the graph layout in JSON format, which can be used for further processing or visualization in other tools.
