To generate a layout for the graph that keeps the community structure clear, we can use the `community` library for community detection and the `networkx` library for graph layout algorithms. The layout will be generated using the `spring_layout` algorithm, which is a force-directed layout that can help visualize communities effectively.

Here is the Python script that generates the layout and outputs it in JSON format:

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import json

# Input graph data as edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 12), (0, 17), (0, 19), 
             (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (4, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 10), 
             (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 17), (8, 9), (8, 10), 
             (9, 11), (10, 11), (12, 13), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17), 
             (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), 
             (15, 16), (15, 17), (16, 17), (18, 20), (18, 22), (19, 20), 
             (19, 21), (20, 21), (21, 22)]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Detect communities using the Louvain method
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Generate a layout using the spring layout algorithm
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)

# Prepare the output in JSON format
layout = {
    "nodes": [],
    "edges": edge_list
}

for node, (x, y) in pos.items():
    layout["nodes"].append({
        "id": node,
        "x": x,
        "y": y,
        "community": partition[node]
    })

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created from the provided edge list using `networkx.Graph()`.
2. **Community Detection**: The Louvain method is used to detect communities in the graph. This method is implemented in the `community` library.
3. **Layout Generation**: The `spring_layout` algorithm is used to generate positions for the nodes. This algorithm simulates a physical system where nodes repel each other, and edges act as springs pulling connected nodes together.
4. **JSON Output**: The layout is formatted into a JSON structure that includes node positions and their respective communities. The edge list is also included in the output.

### Output:
The output is a JSON object that contains the positions of the nodes and their community assignments, along with the original edge list. This JSON can be used by other tools or libraries to visualize the graph while maintaining the community structure.

### Note:
- The `seed=42` in `spring_layout` ensures that the layout is reproducible.
- The `community` library needs to be installed separately (`pip install python-louvain`).
