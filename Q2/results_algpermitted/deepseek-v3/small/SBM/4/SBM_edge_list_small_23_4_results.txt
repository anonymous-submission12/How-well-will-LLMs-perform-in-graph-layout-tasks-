To generate a layout for the graph that keeps the community structure clear, we can use the `networkx` library to handle the graph and community detection, and the `community` library (which is part of `python-louvain`) to detect communities. We will then use the `spring_layout` algorithm to generate positions for the nodes, but we will adjust the positions to ensure that nodes within the same community are closer together.

Here is the Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import json

# Define the graph using the edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 9), (0, 10), 
             (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (2, 3), (2, 4), 
             (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 10), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), 
             (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), (3, 18), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), 
             (4, 9), (5, 6), (5, 9), (5, 10), (6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 20), (7, 8), 
             (7, 9), (7, 10), (8, 9), (8, 10), (9, 20), (11, 12), (11, 13), 
             (11, 14), (11, 17), (11, 18), (11, 19), (11, 20), (12, 13), (12, 14), 
             (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 18), (12, 19), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 17), 
             (13, 19), (13, 20), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), 
             (14, 20), (15, 16), (15, 18), (15, 19), (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 19), 
             (16, 20), (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 20), (18, 19), (18, 20), (19, 20)]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Detect communities using the Louvain method
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Generate a layout using the spring layout algorithm
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)

# Adjust positions to keep communities together
for community in set(partition.values()):
    nodes_in_community = [node for node in partition if partition[node] == community]
    subgraph = G.subgraph(nodes_in_community)
    subgraph_pos = nx.spring_layout(subgraph, seed=42)
    for node in subgraph_pos:
        pos[node] = subgraph_pos[node]

# Convert the positions to a dictionary with node IDs as keys
layout = {str(node): {"x": float(pos[node][0]), "y": float(pos[node][1])} for node in G.nodes()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created from the provided edge list using `networkx`.
2. **Community Detection**: The Louvain method is used to detect communities within the graph.
3. **Layout Generation**: The `spring_layout` algorithm is used to generate initial positions for the nodes. Then, for each community, the positions are adjusted to ensure that nodes within the same community are closer together.
4. **Output**: The final layout is converted to a JSON format where each node is associated with its `x` and `y` coordinates.

This script will output the graph layout in JSON format, which can be used for further visualization or analysis.
