To generate a layout for the graph that keeps the community structure clear, we can use the following approach:

1. **Community Detection**: Use a community detection algorithm to identify communities within the graph.
2. **Graph Layout**: Use a graph layout algorithm to position the nodes, ensuring that nodes within the same community are placed close to each other.

We will use the `networkx` library for graph operations and community detection, and the `community` module (which is part of the `python-louvain` package) for detecting communities. For the layout, we will use the `spring_layout` algorithm, which is a force-directed layout that can be adjusted to respect community structures.

Here is the Python script to achieve this:

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import json

# Define the graph using the provided edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 11), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10),
    (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10),
    (3, 11), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (5, 10), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9),
    (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (9, 11), (9, 22), (12, 13), (12, 14),
    (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17), (12, 18), (12, 19), (12, 20), (12, 21), (12, 22), (12, 23), (13, 14), (13, 15),
    (13, 16), (13, 18), (13, 19), (13, 20), (13, 22), (13, 23), (14, 15), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (14, 20),
    (14, 22), (14, 23), (15, 16), (15, 17), (15, 18), (15, 19), (15, 22), (15, 23), (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 19),
    (16, 22), (16, 23), (17, 19), (17, 20), (17, 21), (17, 22), (17, 23), (18, 20), (18, 21), (18, 23), (19, 21),
    (19, 23), (20, 21), (20, 22), (21, 22), (21, 23)
]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Detect communities using the Louvain method
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Create a layout that respects the community structure
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, weight=None, scale=1, k=None, pos=None, fixed=None, iterations=50, threshold=0.0001, dim=2, seed=None)

# Adjust the layout to group nodes in the same community
for node in G.nodes():
    pos[node][0] += partition[node] * 2  # Adjust x-coordinate based on community
    pos[node][1] += partition[node] * 2  # Adjust y-coordinate based on community

# Convert the layout to a JSON-compatible format
layout = {str(node): {"x": float(pos[node][0]), "y": float(pos[node][1])} for node in G.nodes()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created from the provided edge list.
2. **Community Detection**: The Louvain method is used to detect communities within the graph.
3. **Layout Generation**: The `spring_layout` algorithm is used to generate initial positions for the nodes. The positions are then adjusted based on the community each node belongs to, ensuring that nodes within the same community are placed close to each other.
4. **JSON Output**: The final layout is converted to a JSON format, where each node is mapped to its `x` and `y` coordinates.

This script will output the graph layout in JSON format, which can be used for further processing or visualization.
