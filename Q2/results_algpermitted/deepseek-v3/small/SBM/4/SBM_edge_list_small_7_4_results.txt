To generate a layout for the graph that keeps the community structure clear, we can use the `networkx` library to handle the graph and community detection, and the `community` library (which is part of `python-louvain`) to detect communities. We will then use a force-directed layout algorithm (like Fruchterman-Reingold) to position the nodes, ensuring that nodes within the same community are placed close to each other.

Here is the Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import json

# Define the graph using the provided edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 15), 
             (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), 
             (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), 
             (7, 12), (7, 13), (8, 9), (8, 11), (8, 12), (9, 10), (9, 11), 
             (9, 12), (9, 13), (10, 13), (11, 12), (12, 13), (12, 15), 
             (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18), (15, 16), (15, 18), 
             (15, 19), (15, 20), (16, 17), (16, 20), (17, 18), (17, 19), 
             (17, 20), (18, 19), (19, 20)]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Detect communities using the Louvain method
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Create a layout that respects the community structure
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)  # Use a fixed seed for reproducibility

# Adjust positions to group nodes in the same community
for community in set(partition.values()):
    nodes_in_community = [node for node in partition if partition[node] == community]
    subgraph = G.subgraph(nodes_in_community)
    subgraph_pos = nx.spring_layout(subgraph, pos=pos, seed=42)
    for node in subgraph_pos:
        pos[node] = subgraph_pos[node]

# Convert the positions to a JSON-compatible format
layout = {str(node): {"x": float(pos[node][0]), "y": float(pos[node][1])} for node in pos}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created from the provided edge list.
2. **Community Detection**: The Louvain method is used to detect communities in the graph.
3. **Layout Generation**: A force-directed layout (Fruchterman-Reingold) is generated using `nx.spring_layout`. The positions of nodes within the same community are adjusted to ensure they are grouped together.
4. **JSON Output**: The final layout is converted to a JSON format, where each node is mapped to its `(x, y)` coordinates.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node ID, and the value is an object containing the `x` and `y` coordinates of the node's position in the layout. This JSON can be used to visualize the graph in any visualization tool that accepts JSON input.

```json
{
    "0": {
        "x": 0.123,
        "y": 0.456
    },
    "1": {
        "x": 0.234,
        "y": 0.567
    },
    ...
}
```

This script ensures that the community structure is preserved in the layout, making it easier to visualize and analyze the graph.
