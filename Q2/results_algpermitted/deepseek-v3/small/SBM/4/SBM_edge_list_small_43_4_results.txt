To generate a layout for the graph that keeps the community structure clear, we can use the following approach:

1. **Community Detection**: Use a community detection algorithm to identify communities within the graph.
2. **Graph Layout**: Use a graph layout algorithm to position the nodes. We can use the `spring_layout` algorithm from `networkx` to generate the positions, but we will adjust the positions to ensure that communities are visually separated.
3. **Output**: Finally, we will output the layout in JSON format.

Here is the Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import json

# Input graph data as edge list
edge_list = [(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), 
             (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 22), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), 
             (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 28), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 8), 
             (7, 9), (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 13), (10, 14), (10, 16), (10, 17), (10, 18), (10, 19), (11, 12), 
             (11, 13), (11, 14), (11, 15), (11, 16), (11, 17), (11, 18), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 15), (12, 16), 
             (12, 17), (12, 19), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 18), (13, 19), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), 
             (14, 18), (14, 19), (15, 16), (15, 18), (15, 19), (16, 17), (16, 18), (17, 19), (17, 21), (18, 19), 
             (20, 22), (20, 23), (20, 24), (20, 25), (20, 26), (20, 27), (20, 28), (21, 23), (21, 24), (21, 25), 
             (21, 26), (21, 27), (21, 28), (22, 23), (22, 24), (22, 25), (22, 28), (23, 26), (23, 28), (24, 25), 
             (24, 26), (24, 28), (25, 27), (25, 28), (26, 27), (27, 28)]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Detect communities using the Louvain method
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Create a dictionary to store the positions of nodes
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)

# Adjust positions to separate communities
community_positions = {}
for node, community in partition.items():
    if community not in community_positions:
        community_positions[community] = []
    community_positions[community].append(node)

# Calculate the center of each community
community_centers = {}
for community, nodes in community_positions.items():
    x = sum(pos[node][0] for node in nodes) / len(nodes)
    y = sum(pos[node][1] for node in nodes) / len(nodes)
    community_centers[community] = (x, y)

# Adjust node positions to be around the community centers
for node, (x, y) in pos.items():
    community = partition[node]
    center_x, center_y = community_centers[community]
    pos[node] = (center_x + x * 0.5, center_y + y * 0.5)

# Convert positions to JSON format
layout = {str(node): {"x": float(x), "y": float(y)} for node, (x, y) in pos.items()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Community Detection**: We use the Louvain method (`community_louvain.best_partition`) to detect communities in the graph.
2. **Graph Layout**: We use `nx.spring_layout` to generate initial positions for the nodes. Then, we adjust these positions to ensure that nodes within the same community are grouped together around a common center.
3. **Output**: The final positions are converted to a JSON format, where each node is mapped to its `x` and `y` coordinates.

This script will output the graph layout in JSON format, which can be used for further processing or visualization.
