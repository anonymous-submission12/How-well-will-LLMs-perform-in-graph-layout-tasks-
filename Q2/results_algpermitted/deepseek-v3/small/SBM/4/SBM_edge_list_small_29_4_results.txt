To generate a layout for the graph that keeps the community structure clear, we can use the `networkx` library to handle the graph and community detection, and the `community` library (which is part of `python-louvain`) to detect communities. We will then use the `spring_layout` algorithm to generate positions for the nodes, but we will adjust the positions to ensure that nodes within the same community are closer together.

Here is the Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import json

# Define the graph using the edge list
edge_list = [(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 17), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 17), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 19), (8, 9), (8, 13), (8, 15), (9, 10), (9, 12), (9, 13), (9, 14), (9, 16), (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 13), (10, 15), (11, 12), (11, 13), (11, 14), (11, 15), (12, 13), (12, 14), (13, 14), (13, 15), (14, 15), (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 19), (16, 20), (16, 21), (16, 22), (17, 19), (17, 20), (17, 21), (17, 22), (18, 19), (18, 22), (19, 20), (20, 21)]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Detect communities using the Louvain method
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Generate a layout using the spring layout algorithm
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)

# Adjust positions to keep communities close together
for node in G.nodes():
    community = partition[node]
    pos[node][0] += community * 2  # Shift x-coordinate based on community
    pos[node][1] += community * 2  # Shift y-coordinate based on community

# Convert positions to a dictionary with node IDs as keys and positions as values
layout = {node: {"x": pos[node][0], "y": pos[node][1]} for node in G.nodes()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created from the provided edge list.
2. **Community Detection**: The Louvain method is used to detect communities within the graph.
3. **Layout Generation**: The `spring_layout` algorithm is used to generate initial positions for the nodes.
4. **Community Adjustment**: The positions of nodes are adjusted based on their community membership to ensure that nodes within the same community are closer together.
5. **JSON Output**: The final layout is converted to a JSON format, where each node is associated with its `x` and `y` coordinates.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node ID, and the value is a dictionary containing the `x` and `y` coordinates of the node. This JSON can be used to visualize the graph in any tool that accepts such a format.

```json
{
    "0": {
        "x": 0.123,
        "y": 0.456
    },
    "1": {
        "x": 0.789,
        "y": 0.101
    },
    ...
}
```

This script does not use `matplotlib` or `networkx` to draw the graph visually; it only generates the layout and outputs it in JSON format.
