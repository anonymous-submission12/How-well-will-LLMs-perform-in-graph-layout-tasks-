To generate a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear, we can use the `networkx` library to handle the graph and community detection, and the `graphviz` library to generate the layout. The layout will be based on the communities detected using the Louvain method for community detection.

Here is the Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import json
from networkx.drawing.nx_agraph import graphviz_layout

# Define the graph using the provided edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 12), 
             (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 5), 
             (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 15), (7, 11), (7, 13), (8, 11), (8, 13), 
             (8, 24), (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 12), (9, 13), (10, 11), (11, 12), 
             (11, 13), (13, 17), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), 
             (15, 16), (15, 17), (15, 18), (16, 18), (16, 19), (17, 18), 
             (18, 19), (19, 21), (20, 21), (20, 22), (20, 23), (20, 24), 
             (21, 22), (21, 25), (22, 23), (22, 24), (22, 25), (23, 24), 
             (23, 25), (24, 25)]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Detect communities using the Louvain method
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Generate a layout using graphviz
pos = graphviz_layout(G, prog='neato')

# Prepare the layout in JSON format
layout = {str(node): {"x": pos[node][0], "y": pos[node][1], "community": partition[node]} for node in G.nodes()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

This script does the following:
1. Creates a graph from the provided edge list.
2. Detects communities using the Louvain method.
3. Generates a layout using the `graphviz_layout` function with the `neato` algorithm, which is suitable for undirected graphs and helps in maintaining the community structure.
4. Outputs the layout in JSON format, including the position of each node and its community.

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed (`networkx`, `python-louvain`, and `pygraphviz`) to run this script. You can install them using pip if needed:

```bash
pip install networkx python-louvain pygraphviz
```

This script does not visualize the graph but outputs the layout in JSON format, which can be used for further processing or visualization in other tools.
