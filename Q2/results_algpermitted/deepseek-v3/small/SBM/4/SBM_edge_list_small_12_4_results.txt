To generate a layout for the graph that keeps the community structure clear, we can use the following approach:

1. **Community Detection**: Use a community detection algorithm to identify communities within the graph.
2. **Graph Layout**: Use a force-directed layout algorithm to position the nodes, ensuring that nodes within the same community are placed close to each other.
3. **Output**: Return the layout in JSON format.

We will use the `community` library for community detection and the `networkx` library for graph layout. The final layout will be output in JSON format.

Here is the Python script:

```python
import json
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain

# Input graph as edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 12), 
             (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9), (1, 11), (1, 12), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), 
             (2, 7), (2, 9), (2, 11), (2, 12), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), 
             (3, 12), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 11), (4, 12), (4, 24), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 9), 
             (5, 10), (5, 11), (5, 12), (5, 24), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 17), 
             (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 11), (7, 12), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (8, 12), (9, 11), 
             (10, 12), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 20), (13, 21), (13, 22), (13, 23), 
             (13, 25), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (14, 20), (14, 21), 
             (14, 22), (14, 23), (14, 24), (14, 25), (15, 16), (15, 17), (15, 18), (15, 19), 
             (15, 20), (15, 21), (15, 22), (15, 24), (15, 25), (16, 19), (16, 20), (16, 21), 
             (16, 22), (16, 24), (16, 25), (17, 18), (17, 21), (17, 22), (17, 24), (17, 25), 
             (18, 19), (18, 21), (18, 22), (18, 24), (18, 25), (19, 20), (19, 21), (19, 23), 
             (19, 24), (19, 25), (20, 21), (20, 22), (20, 24), (20, 25), (21, 22), (21, 23), 
             (21, 24), (21, 25), (22, 23), (22, 24), (22, 25), (23, 24), (23, 25), (24, 25)]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Detect communities using the Louvain method
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Create a layout using the spring layout algorithm
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)

# Adjust positions to keep communities close together
for node in G.nodes():
    community = partition[node]
    pos[node][0] += community * 2  # Shift x-coordinate based on community
    pos[node][1] += community * 2  # Shift y-coordinate based on community

# Convert the layout to a dictionary with node IDs as keys and positions as values
layout = {node: {"x": pos[node][0], "y": pos[node][1]} for node in G.nodes()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Community Detection**: The `community_louvain.best_partition(G)` function detects communities using the Louvain method.
2. **Graph Layout**: The `nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)` function generates a force-directed layout. The `seed=42` ensures reproducibility.
3. **Community Adjustment**: The positions of nodes are adjusted based on their community to ensure that nodes within the same community are placed close to each other.
4. **JSON Output**: The layout is converted to a JSON format where each node is associated with its `x` and `y` coordinates.

This script will output the graph layout in JSON format, which can be used for further processing or visualization.
