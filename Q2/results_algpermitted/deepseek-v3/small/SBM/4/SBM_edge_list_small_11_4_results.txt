To generate a graph layout that keeps the community structure clear, we can use the following approach:

1. **Community Detection**: Use a community detection algorithm to identify communities within the graph.
2. **Graph Layout**: Use a force-directed layout algorithm to position the nodes, ensuring that nodes within the same community are placed close to each other.

We will use the `community` library for community detection and the `networkx` library for graph layout. The final layout will be output in JSON format.

Here is the Python script:

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import json

# Input edge list
edge_list = [(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 15), 
             (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), 
             (1, 9), (1, 10), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8), 
             (2, 9), (2, 10), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), 
             (3, 11), (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 11), (5, 7), (5, 9), (5, 10), 
             (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), 
             (7, 23), (8, 9), (8, 10), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), 
             (12, 14), (12, 16), (12, 18), (12, 19), (12, 21), (12, 22), 
             (12, 23), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (13, 18), 
             (13, 19), (13, 20), (13, 23), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), 
             (14, 18), (14, 19), (14, 20), (14, 22), (14, 23), (15, 18), 
             (15, 19), (15, 20), (15, 21), (15, 23), (16, 18), (16, 19), 
             (16, 20), (16, 22), (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 20), (17, 21), 
             (17, 22), (17, 23), (18, 19), (18, 20), (18, 22), (19, 20), 
             (19, 21), (19, 22), (19, 23), (20, 21), (20, 22), (20, 23), 
             (21, 23), (22, 23)]

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Detect communities using the Louvain method
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Create a dictionary to store the positions of nodes
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)

# Adjust positions to keep communities close together
for community in set(partition.values()):
    nodes_in_community = [node for node in partition if partition[node] == community]
    subgraph = G.subgraph(nodes_in_community)
    subgraph_pos = nx.spring_layout(subgraph, seed=42)
    
    # Adjust positions to be centered around the community's centroid
    centroid = nx.center_of_mass(subgraph, subgraph_pos)
    for node in nodes_in_community:
        pos[node] = (pos[node][0] + centroid[0], pos[node][1] + centroid[1])

# Convert positions to JSON format
layout = {str(node): {"x": float(pos[node][0]), "y": float(pos[node][1])} for node in G.nodes()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Community Detection**: The `community_louvain.best_partition(G)` function is used to detect communities in the graph using the Louvain method.
2. **Graph Layout**: The `nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)` function is used to generate a force-directed layout for the graph. The `seed=42` ensures reproducibility.
3. **Community Adjustment**: For each community, we adjust the positions of the nodes to be centered around the community's centroid, ensuring that nodes within the same community are placed close to each other.
4. **JSON Output**: The final layout is converted to a JSON format where each node is mapped to its `(x, y)` coordinates.

This script will output the graph layout in JSON format, which can be used for further processing or visualization.
