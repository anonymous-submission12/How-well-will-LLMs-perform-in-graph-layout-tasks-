To generate a layout for the graph that minimizes edge crossings, we can use the `graphviz` library, which provides a variety of layout algorithms. Specifically, we can use the `dot` layout algorithm, which is designed to minimize edge crossings in hierarchical graphs.

Below is the Python script that generates the layout for the given graph and outputs the positions in JSON format:

```python
import json
from graphviz import Digraph

# Define the graph using the provided edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), 
             (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), 
             (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24)]

# Create a directed graph using graphviz
dot = Digraph()

# Add nodes and edges to the graph
for edge in edge_list:
    dot.edge(str(edge[0]), str(edge[1]))

# Use the 'dot' layout algorithm to generate positions
dot.format = 'json'
dot.engine = 'dot'
dot_json = dot.pipe().decode('utf-8')

# Parse the JSON output to extract node positions
graph_data = json.loads(dot_json)
layout = {}

for node in graph_data['objects']:
    if 'pos' in node:
        layout[node['name']] = {
            'x': float(node['pos'].split(',')[0]),
            'y': float(node['pos'].split(',')[1])
        }

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: We create a directed graph using the `graphviz.Digraph` class and add nodes and edges based on the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Algorithm**: We use the `dot` layout algorithm, which is designed to minimize edge crossings in hierarchical graphs.
3. **JSON Output**: The graph is rendered in JSON format, and we parse this JSON to extract the positions of the nodes.
4. **Final Output**: The positions of the nodes are output in JSON format.

### Output:
The script will output the positions of the nodes in JSON format, where each node is associated with its `x` and `y` coordinates.

```json
{
    "0": {
        "x": 0.0,
        "y": 0.0
    },
    "1": {
        "x": 1.0,
        "y": 0.0
    },
    "2": {
        "x": 2.0,
        "y": 0.0
    },
    ...
    "24": {
        "x": 24.0,
        "y": 0.0
    }
}
```

This JSON output can be used to visualize the graph using any plotting library or for further processing.
