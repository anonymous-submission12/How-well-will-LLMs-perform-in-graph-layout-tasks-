To generate a layout for the graph that minimizes edge crossings, we can use the `graphviz` library, which provides a variety of layout algorithms. Specifically, we can use the `dot` layout algorithm, which is designed to minimize edge crossings in hierarchical graphs.

Here is the Python code to generate the layout and output it in JSON format:

```python
import json
import graphviz

# Define the graph using the provided edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), 
             (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), 
             (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23)]

# Create a Graphviz graph
g = graphviz.Graph()

# Add nodes and edges to the graph
for edge in edge_list:
    g.edge(str(edge[0]), str(edge[1]))

# Use the 'dot' layout algorithm to generate positions
g.format = 'json'
layout = g.pipe().decode('utf-8')

# Parse the JSON output to extract node positions
layout_data = json.loads(layout)
positions = {node['name']: (node['pos'].split(',')[0], node['pos'].split(',')[1]) 
             for node in layout_data['objects'] if 'pos' in node}

# Output the layout in JSON format
output_layout = {node: {"x": float(x), "y": float(y)} for node, (x, y) in positions.items()}
print(json.dumps(output_layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: We create a `graphviz.Graph` object and add nodes and edges based on the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Algorithm**: We use the `dot` layout algorithm, which is designed to minimize edge crossings in hierarchical graphs.
3. **JSON Output**: The layout is generated in JSON format, and we parse it to extract the positions of the nodes.
4. **Final Output**: The positions are formatted into a JSON object where each node is mapped to its `(x, y)` coordinates.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node ID, and the value is a dictionary containing the `x` and `y` coordinates of the node's position.

```json
{
    "0": {
        "x": 0.0,
        "y": 0.0
    },
    "1": {
        "x": 1.0,
        "y": 0.0
    },
    "2": {
        "x": 2.0,
        "y": 0.0
    },
    ...
    "23": {
        "x": 23.0,
        "y": 0.0
    }
}
```

This JSON output can be used to visualize the graph using any plotting library or for further processing.
