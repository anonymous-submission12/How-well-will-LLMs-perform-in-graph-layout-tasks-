To generate a layout for the graph that keeps the community structure clear, we can use the following approach:

1. **Community Detection**: Use a community detection algorithm to identify communities within the graph.
2. **Graph Layout**: Use a graph layout algorithm to position the nodes, ensuring that nodes within the same community are placed close to each other.
3. **Output**: Output the layout in JSON format.

We will use the `networkx` library for graph operations and community detection, and the `community` module (which implements the Louvain method) for community detection. For the layout, we will use the `spring_layout` algorithm, which is a force-directed layout algorithm.

Here is the Python script:

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import json

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Detect communities using the Louvain method

# Adjust positions to keep communities together
for node in G.nodes():
    community = partition[node]
    pos[node][0] += community * 2  # Shift x-coordinate based on community
    pos[node][1] += community * 2  # Shift y-coordinate based on community

# Convert the layout to a dictionary with node IDs as keys and positions as values
layout = {node: {"x": pos[node][0], "y": pos[node][1]} for node in G.nodes()

# Output the layout in JSON format

```

### Explanation:
- **Community Detection**: The `community_louvain.best_partition(G)` function detects communities using the Louvain method.
- **Graph Layout**: The `nx.spring_layout(G, k=0.15, iterations=50)` function generates a layout using the spring layout algorithm. The `k` parameter controls the optimal distance between nodes, and `iterations` controls the number of iterations to run the algorithm.
- **Adjusting Positions**: We adjust the positions of nodes based on their community to ensure that nodes within the same community are placed close to each other.
- **Output**: The layout is converted to a JSON format where each node is associated with its `x` and `y` coordinates.

This script will output the graph layout in JSON format, which you can use for further processing or visualization.
