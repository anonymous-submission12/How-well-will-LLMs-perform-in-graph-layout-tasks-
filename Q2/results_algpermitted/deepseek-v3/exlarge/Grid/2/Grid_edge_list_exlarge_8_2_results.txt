To generate a graph layout that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use the `networkx` library to compute the layout and then output the positions in JSON format. Specifically, we can use the `spring_layout` algorithm, which is designed to position nodes in such a way that the Euclidean distance between nodes approximates their graph-theoretic distance.

Here is the Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the graph using the provided edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 24), (1, 2), (1, 25), (2, 3), (2, 26), (3, 4), (3, 27), 
    (4, 5), (4, 28), (5, 6), (5, 29), (6, 7), (6, 30), (7, 8), (7, 31), 
    (8, 9), (8, 32), (9, 10), (9, 33), (10, 11), (10, 34), (11, 12), 
    (11, 35), (12, 13), (12, 36), (13, 14), (13, 37), (14, 15), (14, 38), 
    (15, 16), (15, 39), (16, 17), (16, 40), (17, 18), (17, 41), (18, 19), 
    (18, 42), (19, 20), (19, 43), (20, 21), (20, 44), (21, 22), (21, 45), 
    (22, 23), (22, 46), (23, 47), (24, 25), (24, 48), (25, 26), (25, 49), 
    (26, 27), (26, 50), (27, 28), (27, 51), (28, 29), (28, 52), (29, 30), 
    (29, 53), (30, 31), (30, 54), (31, 32), (31, 55), (32, 33), (32, 56), 
    (33, 34), (33, 57), (34, 35), (34, 58), (35, 36), (35, 59), (36, 37), 
    (36, 60), (37, 38), (37, 61), (38, 39), (38, 62), (39, 40), (39, 63), 
    (40, 41), (40, 64), (41, 42), (41, 65), (42, 43), (42, 66), (43, 44), 
    (43, 67), (44, 45), (44, 68), (45, 46), (45, 69), (46, 47), (46, 70), 
    (47, 71), (48, 49), (49, 50), (50, 51), (51, 52), (52, 53), (53, 54), 
    (54, 55), (55, 56), (56, 57), (57, 58), (58, 59), (59, 60), (60, 61), 
    (61, 62), (62, 63), (63, 64), (64, 65), (65, 66), (66, 67), (67, 68), 
    (68, 69), (69, 70), (70, 71)

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Compute the layout using the spring layout algorithm
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, k=0.15, iterations=50)

# Convert the positions to a dictionary with node IDs as keys and positions as values
layout = {node: [float(pos[node][0]), float(pos[node][1])] for node in G.nodes()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created using the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Calculation**: The `spring_layout` algorithm is used to compute the positions of the nodes. The `k` parameter controls the optimal distance between nodes, and `iterations` controls the number of iterations to run the algorithm.
3. **JSON Output**: The positions are converted to a dictionary where each node ID maps to its position, and then the dictionary is output in JSON format.

This script will output the graph layout in JSON format, which you can use for further processing or visualization.
