To generate a graph layout that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use the `networkx` library to compute the layout and then output the positions in JSON format. Specifically, we can use the `spring_layout` algorithm, which is designed to position nodes in such a way that the Euclidean distance between nodes approximates their graph-theoretic distance.

Here is the Python script to achieve this:

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the graph using the provided edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 13), (1, 2), (1, 14), (2, 3), (2, 15), (3, 4), (3, 16), (4, 5), (4, 17), 
    (5, 6), (5, 18), (6, 7), (6, 19), (7, 8), (7, 20), (8, 9), (8, 21), (9, 10), (9, 22), 
    (10, 11), (10, 23), (11, 12), (11, 24), (12, 25), (13, 14), (13, 26), (14, 15), (14, 27), 
    (15, 16), (15, 28), (16, 17), (16, 29), (17, 18), (17, 30), (18, 19), (18, 31), (19, 20), 
    (19, 32), (20, 21), (20, 33), (21, 22), (21, 34), (22, 23), (22, 35), (23, 24), (23, 36), 
    (24, 25), (24, 37), (25, 38), (26, 27), (26, 39), (27, 28), (27, 40), (28, 29), (28, 41), 
    (29, 30), (29, 42), (30, 31), (30, 43), (31, 32), (31, 44), (32, 33), (32, 45), (33, 34), 
    (33, 46), (34, 35), (34, 47), (35, 36), (35, 48), (36, 37), (36, 49), (37, 38), (37, 50), 
    (38, 51), (39, 40), (39, 52), (40, 41), (40, 53), (41, 42), (41, 54), (42, 43), (42, 55), 
    (43, 44), (43, 56), (44, 45), (44, 57), (45, 46), (45, 58), (46, 47), (46, 59), (47, 48), 
    (47, 60), (48, 49), (48, 61), (49, 50), (49, 62), (50, 51), (50, 63), (51, 64), (52, 53), 
    (52, 65), (53, 54), (53, 66), (54, 55), (54, 67), (55, 56), (55, 68), (56, 57), (56, 69), 
    (57, 58), (57, 70), (58, 59), (58, 71), (59, 60), (59, 72), (60, 61), (60, 73), (61, 62),

    (68, 69), (69, 70), (70, 71), (71, 72), (72, 73), (73, 74), (74, 75), (75, 76), (76, 77)

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Compute the layout using the spring layout algorithm
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)  # seed for reproducibility

# Convert the positions to a dictionary with node IDs as keys and positions as values
layout = {node: [float(pos[node][0]), float(pos[node][1])] for node in G.nodes()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created using the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Calculation**: The `spring_layout` algorithm is used to compute the positions of the nodes. This algorithm tries to position nodes such that the Euclidean distance between nodes approximates their graph-theoretic distance.
3. **JSON Output**: The positions are converted to a dictionary and then output in JSON format.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node ID, and the value is a list of two floats representing the x and y coordinates of the node's position.

You can run this script in a Python environment to get the JSON output.
