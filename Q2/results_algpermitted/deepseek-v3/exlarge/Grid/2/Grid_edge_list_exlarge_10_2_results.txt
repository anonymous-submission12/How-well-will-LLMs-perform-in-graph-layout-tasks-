To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use the `networkx` library to compute the layout and then output the positions in JSON format. Specifically, we can use the `spring_layout` algorithm, which is designed to position nodes in such a way that the Euclidean distance between nodes approximates their graph-theoretic distance.

Here is the Python script to achieve this:

```python
import networkx as nx
import json

# Define the graph using the provided edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 11), (1, 2), (1, 12), (2, 3), (2, 13), (3, 4), (3, 14), (4, 5), (4, 15), 
    (5, 6), (5, 16), (6, 7), (6, 17), (7, 8), (7, 18), (8, 9), (8, 19), (9, 10), (9, 20), 
    (10, 21), (11, 12), (11, 22), (12, 13), (12, 23), (13, 14), (13, 24), (14, 15), (14, 25), 
    (15, 16), (15, 26), (16, 17), (16, 27), (17, 18), (17, 28), (18, 19), (18, 29), (19, 20), 
    (19, 30), (20, 21), (20, 31), (21, 32), (22, 23), (22, 33), (23, 24), (23, 34), (24, 25), 
    (24, 35), (25, 26), (25, 36), (26, 27), (26, 37), (27, 28), (27, 38), (28, 29), (28, 39), 
    (29, 30), (29, 40), (30, 31), (30, 41), (31, 32), (31, 42), (32, 43), (33, 34), (33, 44), 
    (34, 35), (34, 45), (35, 36), (35, 46), (36, 37), (36, 47), (37, 38), (37, 48), (38, 39), 
    (38, 49), (39, 40), (39, 50), (40, 41), (40, 51), (41, 42), (41, 52), (42, 43), (42, 53), 
    (43, 54), (44, 45), (44, 55), (45, 46), (45, 56), (46, 47), (46, 57), (47, 48), (47, 58), 
    (48, 49), (48, 59), (49, 50), (49, 60), (50, 51), (50, 61), (51, 52), (51, 62), (52, 53), 
    (52, 63), (53, 54), (53, 64), (54, 65), (55, 56), (55, 66), (56, 57), (56, 67), (57, 58), 
    (57, 68), (58, 59), (58, 69), (59, 60), (59, 70), (60, 61), (60, 71), (61, 62), (61, 72), 
    (62, 63), (62, 73), (63, 64), (63, 74), (64, 65), (64, 75), (65, 76), (66, 67), (67, 68), 
    (68, 69), (69, 70), (70, 71), (71, 72), (72, 73), (73, 74), (74, 75), (75, 76)

# Create a graph from the edge list
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Compute the layout using the spring layout algorithm
pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)  # seed for reproducibility

# Convert the positions to a dictionary with node IDs as keys and positions as values
layout = {node: [float(pos[node][0]), float(pos[node][1])] for node in G.nodes()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Creation**: The graph is created using the provided edge list.
2. **Layout Calculation**: The `spring_layout` algorithm is used to compute the positions of the nodes. This algorithm tries to position nodes such that the Euclidean distance between nodes approximates their graph-theoretic distance.
3. **JSON Output**: The positions are converted to a dictionary and then output in JSON format.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node ID, and the value is a list containing the x and y coordinates of the node's position.

You can run this script in a Python environment to get the JSON output.
