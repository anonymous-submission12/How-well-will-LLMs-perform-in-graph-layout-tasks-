def layout_graph(edges):
    """
    Generates a layout for a graph to minimize edge crossings.

    This function implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm. It initializes
    node positions randomly and then iteratively adjusts them based on attractive
    and repulsive forces between nodes.

    Args:
        edges: A list of tuples representing the edges of the graph. Each tuple
               contains the indices of the two connected nodes.

    Returns:
        A dictionary where keys are node indices and values are (x, y) coordinates
        representing the layout.  The layout is returned as a JSON string.
