def layout_graph(edge_list):
    """
    Generates a layout for a graph to minimize edge crossings.

    This function implements a simple force-based layout algorithm.  It initializes
    node positions randomly and then iteratively adjusts them based on attractive
    and repulsive forces.  Nodes connected by edges attract each other, while all
    nodes repel each other.  The goal is to find a stable configuration where
    the forces are balanced, resulting in a layout with fewer edge crossings.

    Args:
        edge_list: A list of tuples representing the edges of the graph. Each tuple
                   contains the node indices of the connected nodes.

    Returns:
        A dictionary where keys are node indices and values are (x, y) coordinates
        representing the layout of the graph.  The layout is returned in JSON format.
