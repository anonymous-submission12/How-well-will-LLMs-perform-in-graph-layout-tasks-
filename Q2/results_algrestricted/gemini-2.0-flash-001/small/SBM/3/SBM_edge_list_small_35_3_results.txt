def layout_graph(edges):
    """
    Generates a layout for a graph to minimize edge crossings.

    This function implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm.  It initializes
    node positions randomly and then iteratively adjusts them based on attractive and
    repulsive forces.  Nodes connected by edges attract each other, while all nodes
    repel each other.

    Args:
        edges: A list of tuples representing the edges of the graph.  Each tuple
               should contain the node indices of the two connected nodes.

    Returns:
        A dictionary where keys are node indices and values are (x, y) coordinates.
        This dictionary represents the layout of the graph.
