def generate_graph_layout(edges):
    """
    Generates a graph layout that attempts to minimize edge crossings.

    This implementation uses a force-directed layout approach with some
    simplifications to avoid external libraries.  It iteratively adjusts
    node positions based on attractive and repulsive forces.

    Args:
        edges: A list of tuples representing the graph's edges.

    Returns:
        A dictionary where keys are node IDs and values are (x, y) coordinates.
