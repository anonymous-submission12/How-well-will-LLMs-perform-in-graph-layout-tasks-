def generate_layout(edge_list):
    """
    Generates a graph layout that attempts to minimize edge crossings.

    This implementation uses a simple force-directed layout approach.  It initializes
    nodes with random positions and then iteratively adjusts their positions based on
    attractive and repulsive forces.  Attractive forces pull connected nodes together,
    while repulsive forces push all nodes apart.

    Args:
        edge_list: A list of tuples representing the graph's edges.

    Returns:
        A dictionary where keys are node IDs and values are (x, y) coordinates.
        The layout is also returned as a JSON string.
