    """
    Generates a graph layout that attempts to maintain consistency between
    Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance using a force-based approach.

    Args:
        edge_list: A list of tuples representing the edges of the graph.
        dimensions: The number of dimensions for the layout (default: 2).
        iterations: The number of iterations to run the layout algorithm (default: 100).
        initial_temperature: The initial temperature for simulated annealing (default: 1.0).
        cooling_rate: The cooling rate for simulated annealing (default: 0.95).

    Returns:
        A dictionary where keys are node indices and values are lists representing
        the coordinates of the node in the layout.  Returns in JSON format.
