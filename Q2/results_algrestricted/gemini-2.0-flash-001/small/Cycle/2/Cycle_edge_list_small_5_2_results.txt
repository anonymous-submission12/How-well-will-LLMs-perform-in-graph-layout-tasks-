def layout_graph(edge_list):
    """
    Generates a layout for a graph, attempting to maintain consistency
    between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance.

    This implementation uses a simple force-based approach.  Nodes are
    initially placed randomly, and then repulsive forces between all nodes
    and attractive forces between connected nodes are applied iteratively
    to refine the layout.

    Args:
        edge_list: A list of tuples representing the edges of the graph.
                   Each tuple (u, v) indicates an edge between node u and node v.

    Returns:
        A dictionary where keys are node indices and values are lists
        representing the (x, y) coordinates of the node in the layout.
        Returns in JSON format.
