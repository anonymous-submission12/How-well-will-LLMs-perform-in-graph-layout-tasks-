def layout_graph(edge_list):
    """
    Generates a layout for a graph to minimize edge crossings.

    This function implements a simple layout algorithm that attempts to
    minimize edge crossings by placing nodes in a circular arrangement
    and then adjusting their positions based on their connections.

    Args:
        edge_list: A list of tuples representing the edges of the graph.
                   Each tuple should contain two node indices.

    Returns:
        A dictionary where keys are node indices and values are tuples
        representing the (x, y) coordinates of the node in the layout.
