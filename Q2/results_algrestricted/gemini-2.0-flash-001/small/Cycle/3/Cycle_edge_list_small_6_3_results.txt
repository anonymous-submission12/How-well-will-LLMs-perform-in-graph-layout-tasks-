def layout_graph(edge_list):
    """
    Generates a graph layout that attempts to minimize edge crossings.

    This implementation uses a force-directed layout approach with some
    simplifications to avoid external libraries.  It's not a perfect
    solution for minimizing crossings, but it provides a reasonable layout.

    Args:
        edge_list: A list of tuples representing the graph's edges.

    Returns:
        A dictionary where keys are node IDs and values are (x, y) coordinates.
