def generate_layout(edges):
    """
    Generates a graph layout to minimize edge crossings.

    This function implements a simple layering approach.  It first identifies
    nodes with degree 1 as starting points for layers.  Then, it iteratively
    builds layers by following the edges.  Nodes are placed on a circle
    within each layer to further reduce crossings.

    Args:
        edges: A list of tuples representing the graph's edges.

    Returns:
        A dictionary where keys are node IDs and values are (x, y) coordinates.
