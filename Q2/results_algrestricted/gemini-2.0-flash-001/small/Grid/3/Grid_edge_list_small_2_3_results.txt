def generate_graph_layout(edges):
    """
    Generates a graph layout to minimize edge crossings.

    This function implements a simple layering approach.  It first determines
    the degree of each node.  Then, it assigns nodes to layers based on their
    degree, starting with nodes of lower degree.  Finally, it positions nodes
    within each layer to minimize crossings.

    Args:
        edges: A list of tuples representing the graph's edges.

    Returns:
        A dictionary representing the graph layout, where keys are node IDs
        and values are (x, y) coordinates.  The layout is returned in JSON format.
