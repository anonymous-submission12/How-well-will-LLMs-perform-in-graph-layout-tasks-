def generate_graph_layout(edges):
    """
    Generates a graph layout that attempts to minimize edge crossings.

    This function implements a simple force-based layout algorithm.  It initializes
    node positions randomly and then iteratively adjusts them based on attractive
    and repulsive forces.  Attractive forces pull connected nodes together, while
    repulsive forces push all nodes apart.  The goal is to find a configuration
    where the forces are balanced, resulting in a layout with fewer edge crossings.

    Args:
        edges: A list of tuples representing the graph's edges.  Each tuple
               contains the indices of the two connected nodes.

    Returns:
        A dictionary where keys are node indices and values are (x, y) coordinates.
        The layout is returned in JSON format.
