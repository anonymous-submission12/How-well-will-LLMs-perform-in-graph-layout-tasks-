def graph_layout(edges):
    """
    Generates a layout for a graph to minimize edge crossings.

    This function implements a simple layering approach.  It first identifies
    nodes with degree 1 (leaves) and assigns them to the outermost layers.
    Then, it iteratively moves inwards, assigning layers to the remaining nodes
    based on their distance from the leaves.  Finally, nodes within each layer
    are arranged to minimize crossings based on a simple sorting heuristic.

    Args:
        edges: A list of tuples representing the graph's edges.

    Returns:
        A dictionary where keys are node IDs and values are (x, y) coordinates.
        The layout is also returned as a JSON string.
