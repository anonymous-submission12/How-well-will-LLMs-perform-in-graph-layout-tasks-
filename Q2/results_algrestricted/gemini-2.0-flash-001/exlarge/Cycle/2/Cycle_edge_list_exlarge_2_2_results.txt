def layout_graph(edge_list):
    """
    Generates a layout for a graph given its edge list, attempting to maintain
    consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance.

    This implementation uses a simple force-based approach.  It initializes
    nodes randomly in a 2D space and then iteratively adjusts their positions
    based on attractive and repulsive forces.  Nodes connected by edges attract
    each other, while all nodes repel each other.

    Args:
        edge_list: A list of tuples representing the edges of the graph.
                   Each tuple (u, v) indicates an edge between node u and node v.

    Returns:
        A dictionary where keys are node IDs and values are (x, y) coordinates
        representing the layout.  The layout is also returned as a JSON string.
