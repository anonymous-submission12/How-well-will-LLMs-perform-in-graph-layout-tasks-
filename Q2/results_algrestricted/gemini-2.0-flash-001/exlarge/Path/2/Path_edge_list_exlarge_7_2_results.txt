    Generates a layout for a graph represented as an edge list.
    The layout aims to maintain consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance.

        edge_list: A list of tuples representing the edges of the graph.  Each tuple
                   contains the node indices of the connected nodes.

    Returns:
        A dictionary representing the layout, where keys are node indices and values
        are lists representing the (x, y) coordinates of the node.  The layout is
        also returned as a JSON string.
