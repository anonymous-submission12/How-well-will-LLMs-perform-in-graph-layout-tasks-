def generate_layout(edge_list):
    """
    Generates a layout for a graph represented as an edge list.
    The layout aims to maintain consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance.

    Args:
        edge_list: A list of tuples representing the edges of the graph.  Each tuple
                   contains the node indices (integers) of the connected nodes.

    Returns:
        A JSON string representing the layout. The JSON object is a dictionary where
        keys are node indices (as strings) and values are lists of two floats representing
        the x and y coordinates of the node in the layout.
