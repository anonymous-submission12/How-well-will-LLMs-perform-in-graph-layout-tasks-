def layout_graph(edge_list):
    """
    Generates a layout for a graph to minimize edge crossings.

    This function implements a simple layering approach.  It first identifies
    nodes with degree 1 (leaves) and assigns them to the outermost layer.
    Then, it iteratively moves inwards, assigning nodes to layers based on
    the layers of their neighbors.  Finally, nodes within each layer are
    arranged to minimize crossings (a simple greedy approach is used).

    Args:
        edge_list: A list of tuples representing the edges of the graph.

    Returns:
        A dictionary where keys are node IDs and values are (x, y) coordinates.
