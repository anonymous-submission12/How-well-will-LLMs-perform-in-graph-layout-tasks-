def layout_graph(edge_list):
    """
    Generates a layout for a graph to minimize edge crossings.

    This function implements a simple layering approach.  It first identifies
    nodes with degree 1 (leaves) and assigns them to the outermost layers.
    Then, it iteratively moves inward, assigning nodes to layers based on the
    average layer of their neighbors.  Finally, it refines the positions within
    each layer to minimize crossings.

    Args:
        edge_list: A list of tuples representing the edges of the graph.

    Returns:
        A dictionary where keys are node IDs and values are (x, y) coordinates.
