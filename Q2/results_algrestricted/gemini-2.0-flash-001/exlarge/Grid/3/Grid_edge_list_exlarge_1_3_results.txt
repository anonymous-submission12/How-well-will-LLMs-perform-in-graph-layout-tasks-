def layout_graph(edge_list):
    """
    Generates a layout for a graph to minimize edge crossings.

    This function implements a simple layered approach.  It first identifies
    a longest path in the graph and assigns nodes on that path to layers.
    Then, it assigns remaining nodes to layers based on their distance from
    the nodes on the longest path.  Finally, it positions nodes within each
    layer to minimize crossings (a simple greedy approach is used).

    Args:
        edge_list: A list of tuples representing the edges of the graph.

    Returns:
        A dictionary where keys are node IDs and values are (x, y) coordinates.
