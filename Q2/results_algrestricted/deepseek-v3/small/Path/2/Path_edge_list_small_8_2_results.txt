To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a simple approach where we place the nodes in a straight line. This approach ensures that the Euclidean distance between adjacent nodes is consistent with the graph-theoretic distance (which is 1 for adjacent nodes).

Here is the Python code to generate the layout:

```python
import json

# Input edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), 
             (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), 
             (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26), 
             (26, 27)]

# Determine the number of nodes
num_nodes = max(max(edge) for edge in edge_list) + 1

# Generate positions in a straight line
positions = {i: (i, 0) for i in range(num_nodes)}

# Convert positions to JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Edge List**: The input edge list represents the connections between nodes.
2. **Number of Nodes**: We determine the number of nodes by finding the maximum node index in the edge list and adding 1.
3. **Positions**: We place each node in a straight line along the x-axis, with the y-coordinate set to 0. The x-coordinate is simply the node index.
4. **JSON Output**: The positions are converted to a JSON format, which can be used as the graph layout.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node index, and the value is a tuple representing the (x, y) coordinates of the node.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 0],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [3, 0],
    "4": [4, 0],
    "5": [5, 0],
    "6": [6, 0],
    "7": [7, 0],
    "8": [8, 0],
    "9": [9, 0],
    "10": [10, 0],
    "11": [11, 0],
    "12": [12, 0],
    "13": [13, 0],
    "14": [14, 0],
    "15": [15, 0],
    "16": [16, 0],
    "17": [17, 0],
    "18": [18, 0],
    "19": [19, 0],
    "20": [20, 0],
    "21": [21, 0],
    "22": [22, 0],
    "23": [23, 0],
    "24": [24, 0],
    "25": [25, 0],
    "26": [26, 0],
    "27": [27, 0]
}
```

This layout ensures that the Euclidean distance between adjacent nodes is 1, which matches the graph-theoretic distance.
