To generate a layout for the graph that minimizes edge crossings, we can use a simple approach where we arrange the nodes in a circular layout. This layout naturally minimizes edge crossings for linear graphs like the one provided. The nodes will be placed evenly around a circle, and the edges will be straight lines connecting the nodes.

Here is the Python code to generate the layout:

```python
import math
import json

def generate_circular_layout(edge_list):
    # Extract unique nodes from the edge list
    nodes = sorted(set([node for edge in edge_list for node in edge]))
    num_nodes = len(nodes)
    
    # Calculate the positions for each node on a circle
    radius = 1.0  # Radius of the circle
    center = (0.0, 0.0)  # Center of the circle
    angle_increment = (2 * math.pi) / num_nodes
    
    layout = {}
    for i, node in enumerate(nodes):
        angle = i * angle_increment
        x = center[0] + radius * math.cos(angle)
        y = center[1] + radius * math.sin(angle)
        layout[node] = (x, y)
    
    return layout

# Provided edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23)]

# Generate the layout
layout = generate_circular_layout(edge_list)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Extract Unique Nodes**: We first extract the unique nodes from the edge list.
2. **Calculate Positions**: We calculate the positions of the nodes on a circle. The nodes are evenly spaced around the circle.
3. **Generate Layout**: We create a dictionary where each node is mapped to its corresponding position on the circle.
4. **Output JSON**: Finally, we output the layout in JSON format.

This code will generate a circular layout for the given graph, which minimizes edge crossings for linear graphs like the one provided. The output will be a JSON object where each node is mapped to its position on the circle.
