To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a simple approach based on the concept of "force-directed" layout. The idea is to simulate physical forces between nodes and iteratively adjust their positions until the system reaches a stable state.

Here is a Python script that implements this approach:

```python
import json
import math

# Define the graph as an edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 22), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22)]

# Initialize node positions randomly
num_nodes = 23
positions = {i: [0.0, 0.0] for i in range(num_nodes)}

# Parameters for the force-directed layout
k = 1.0  # Spring constant
repulsion_constant = 100.0  # Repulsion constant
iterations = 1000
dt = 0.1  # Time step

# Function to calculate the Euclidean distance between two nodes
def euclidean_distance(pos1, pos2):
    return math.sqrt((pos1[0] - pos2[0])**2 + (pos1[1] - pos2[1])**2)

# Force-directed layout algorithm
for iteration in range(iterations):
    # Calculate forces on each node
    forces = {i: [0.0, 0.0] for i in range(num_nodes)}
    
    # Repulsion forces between all pairs of nodes
    for i in range(num_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, num_nodes):
            dx = positions[j][0] - positions[i][0]
            dy = positions[j][1] - positions[i][1]
            distance = euclidean_distance(positions[i], positions[j])
            if distance > 0:
                force = repulsion_constant / (distance ** 2)
                forces[i][0] -= force * dx / distance
                forces[i][1] -= force * dy / distance
                forces[j][0] += force * dx / distance
                forces[j][1] += force * dy / distance
    
    # Attraction forces between connected nodes
    for u, v in edge_list:
        dx = positions[v][0] - positions[u][0]
        dy = positions[v][1] - positions[u][1]
        distance = euclidean_distance(positions[u], positions[v])
        if distance > 0:
            force = k * distance
            forces[u][0] += force * dx / distance
            forces[u][1] += force * dy / distance
            forces[v][0] -= force * dx / distance
            forces[v][1] -= force * dy / distance
    
    # Update positions based on forces
    for i in range(num_nodes):
        positions[i][0] += forces[i][0] * dt
        positions[i][1] += forces[i][1] * dt

# Convert positions to JSON format
layout = {str(node): pos for node, pos in positions.items()}
layout_json = json.dumps(layout, indent=4)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The positions of the nodes are initialized randomly. In this case, they are initialized to `(0.0, 0.0)` for simplicity.
2. **Force Calculation**:
   - **Repulsion Forces**: Nodes repel each other inversely proportional to the square of their distance.
   - **Attraction Forces**: Connected nodes attract each other proportionally to their distance.
3. **Position Update**: The positions of the nodes are updated based on the calculated forces.
4. **Iteration**: The process is repeated for a fixed number of iterations to allow the system to stabilize.
5. **Output**: The final positions of the nodes are output in JSON format.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node ID, and the value is a list of two numbers representing the `(x, y)` coordinates of the node.

This script does not use any existing graph layout algorithms or libraries like `networkx` or `matplotlib` for visualization. The final output is the graph layout in JSON format.
