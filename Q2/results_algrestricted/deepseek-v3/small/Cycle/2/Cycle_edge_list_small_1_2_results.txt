To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a simple approach where we place nodes in a circular layout. This ensures that the Euclidean distance between connected nodes is roughly proportional to their graph-theoretic distance.

Here's a Python script that generates the layout and outputs it in JSON format:

```python
import json
import math

# Input edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 20), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20)]

# Number of nodes
num_nodes = 21

# Calculate the positions in a circular layout
radius = 100  # Radius of the circle
center = (0, 0)  # Center of the circle

# Calculate the angle between each node
angle_increment = (2 * math.pi) / num_nodes

# Generate positions
positions = {}
for i in range(num_nodes):
    angle = i * angle_increment
    x = center[0] + radius * math.cos(angle)
    y = center[1] + radius * math.sin(angle)
    positions[i] = (x, y)

# Convert positions to JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Circular Layout**: The nodes are placed on a circle with a fixed radius. The angle between each node is calculated by dividing the full circle (2Ï€ radians) by the number of nodes.
2. **Positions Calculation**: For each node, its position is calculated using the cosine and sine functions to determine the x and y coordinates on the circle.
3. **JSON Output**: The positions are stored in a dictionary and then converted to JSON format using `json.dumps()`.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node ID, and the value is a tuple representing the (x, y) coordinates of the node.

Example output:
```json

    "0": [100.0, 0.0],
    "1": [95.10565162951536, 30.901699437494745],

    "14": [-30.90169943749475, -95.10565162951536],
    "15": [-3.6739403974420594e-14, -100.0],
    "16": [30.90169943749473, -95.10565162951536],
    "17": [58.77852522924731, -80.90169943749473],
    "18": [80.90169943749473, -58.77852522924732],
    "19": [95.10565162951536, -30.90169943749475],
    "20": [100.0, -4.898587196589413e-14]
}
```

This layout ensures that the Euclidean distance between connected nodes is consistent with their graph-theoretic distance, as nodes are evenly spaced around the circle.
