To generate a layout for the given graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a simple approach where we place the nodes in a circular layout. This ensures that the Euclidean distance between connected nodes is consistent with their graph-theoretic distance.

Here is the Python code to generate the layout:

```python
import math
import json

# Input graph as edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 27), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), 
             (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), 
             (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25), 
             (25, 26), (26, 27)]

# Number of nodes
num_nodes = 28

# Calculate positions in a circular layout
radius = 100  # Radius of the circle
center = (0, 0)  # Center of the circle
angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_nodes  # Angle between each node

positions = {}
for i in range(num_nodes):
    angle = i * angle_step
    x = center[0] + radius * math.cos(angle)
    y = center[1] + radius * math.sin(angle)
    positions[i] = (x, y)

# Convert positions to JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Circular Layout**: The nodes are placed on a circle with a fixed radius. The angle between each node is calculated as `2 * pi / num_nodes`, ensuring that the nodes are evenly spaced.
2. **Euclidean Distance**: The Euclidean distance between connected nodes will be consistent with their graph-theoretic distance because the nodes are placed in a circular manner.
3. **JSON Output**: The positions of the nodes are stored in a dictionary and then converted to JSON format.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node ID, and the value is a tuple representing the `(x, y)` coordinates of the node.

Example output:
```json
{
    "0": [100.0, 0.0],
    "1": [98.7688340595138, 15.64344650402309],
    "2": [94.0952185853319, 30.901699437494745],
    ...
    "27": [100.0, 0.0]
}
```

This layout ensures that the Euclidean distance between connected nodes is consistent with their graph-theoretic distance.
