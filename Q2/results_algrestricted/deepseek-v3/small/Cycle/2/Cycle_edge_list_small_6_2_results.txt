To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a simple approach where we place the nodes in a circular layout. This ensures that the Euclidean distance between connected nodes is consistent with their graph-theoretic distance.

Here is the Python code to generate the layout:

```python
import math
import json

# Input edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 25), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25)]

# Number of nodes
num_nodes = 26

# Calculate positions in a circular layout
radius = 100  # Radius of the circle
center = (0, 0)  # Center of the circle
angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_nodes  # Angle between each node

positions = {}
for i in range(num_nodes):
    angle = i * angle_step
    x = center[0] + radius * math.cos(angle)
    y = center[1] + radius * math.sin(angle)
    positions[i] = (x, y)

# Convert positions to JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Circular Layout**: The nodes are placed on a circle with a fixed radius. The angle between each node is calculated as `2 * pi / num_nodes`, where `num_nodes` is the total number of nodes in the graph.
2. **Positions Calculation**: For each node, its position is calculated using the polar coordinates `(r, θ)`, where `r` is the radius of the circle and `θ` is the angle corresponding to the node's position on the circle.
3. **JSON Output**: The positions are stored in a dictionary and then converted to JSON format using `json.dumps()`.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node ID, and the value is a tuple representing the `(x, y)` coordinates of the node.

This JSON object represents the positions of the nodes in the graph. The positions are calculated such that the Euclidean distance between connected nodes is consistent with their graph-theoretic distance.
