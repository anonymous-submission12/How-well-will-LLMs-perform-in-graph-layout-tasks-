To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a simple approach where we place the nodes in a circular layout. This ensures that the Euclidean distance between connected nodes is roughly proportional to their graph-theoretic distance.

Here's a Python script that generates the layout and outputs it in JSON format:

```python
import json
import math

# Input edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 21), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21)]

# Number of nodes
num_nodes = 22

# Calculate the angle between each node in the circle
angle_increment = 2 * math.pi / num_nodes

# Generate positions for each node
positions = {}
for i in range(num_nodes):
    angle = i * angle_increment
    x = math.cos(angle)
    y = math.sin(angle)
    positions[i] = {"x": x, "y": y}

# Output the positions in JSON format
output_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)
print(output_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Circular Layout**: The nodes are placed on a unit circle. The angle between each node is calculated as `2 * pi / num_nodes`, where `num_nodes` is the total number of nodes in the graph.
2. **Position Calculation**: For each node, the position is calculated using the cosine and sine of the angle, which gives the (x, y) coordinates on the unit circle.
3. **JSON Output**: The positions are stored in a dictionary and then converted to JSON format.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node ID, and the value is a dictionary containing the `x` and `y` coordinates of the node.

Example output:
```json
{
    "0": {
        "x": 1.0,
        "y": 0.0
    },
    "1": {
        "x": 0.9594929736144974,
        "y": 0.28173255684142967
    },
    "2": {
        "x": 0.8412535328311812,
        "y": 0.5406408174555976
    },
    ...
    "21": {
        "x": 0.9594929736144974,
        "y": -0.28173255684142967
    }
}
```

This layout ensures that the Euclidean distance between connected nodes is consistent with their graph-theoretic distance, as nodes that are close in the graph will also be close in the Euclidean space.
