To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a simple approach where we place nodes in a circular layout. This ensures that the Euclidean distance between connected nodes is roughly proportional to their graph-theoretic distance.

Here's a Python script that generates the layout and outputs it in JSON format:

```python
import json
import math

# Input edge list
edges = [(0, 1), (0, 28), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), 
         (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), 
         (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25), 
         (25, 26), (26, 27), (27, 28)]

# Number of nodes
num_nodes = 29

# Calculate positions in a circular layout
radius = 100  # Radius of the circle
center = (0, 0)  # Center of the circle
angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_nodes  # Angle between each node

positions = {}
for i in range(num_nodes):
    angle = i * angle_step
    x = center[0] + radius * math.cos(angle)
    y = center[1] + radius * math.sin(angle)
    positions[i] = (x, y)

# Convert positions to JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Circular Layout**: The nodes are placed on a circle with a fixed radius. The angle between each node is calculated as `2 * pi / num_nodes`, where `num_nodes` is the total number of nodes in the graph.
2. **Positions Calculation**: For each node, its position is calculated using the polar coordinates `(radius * cos(angle), radius * sin(angle))`, where `angle` is the angle corresponding to the node's position on the circle.
3. **JSON Output**: The positions are stored in a dictionary and then converted to JSON format using `json.dumps()`.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node ID, and the value is a tuple representing the `(x, y)` coordinates of the node.
