To generate a layout for the given graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a simple approach where we place the central node (node 0) at the origin and place the other nodes at equal distances from the center in a circular fashion. This ensures that the Euclidean distance between the central node and any other node is consistent with the graph-theoretic distance (which is 1 for all edges).

Here is the Python code to generate the layout:

```python
import math
import json

# Define the edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), 
             (0, 11), (0, 12), (0, 13), (0, 14), (0, 15), (0, 16), (0, 17), (0, 18), (0, 19), 
             (0, 20), (0, 21), (0, 22), (0, 23), (0, 24), (0, 25), (0, 26), (0, 27), (0, 28)]

# Number of nodes
num_nodes = 29

# Radius of the circle
radius = 100.0

# Calculate the angle between each node
angle_increment = (2 * math.pi) / (num_nodes - 1)

# Initialize the layout dictionary
layout = {}

# Place the central node (node 0) at the origin
layout[0] = {"x": 0.0, "y": 0.0}

# Place the other nodes in a circular fashion around the center
for i in range(1, num_nodes):
    angle = (i - 1) * angle_increment
    x = radius * math.cos(angle)
    y = radius * math.sin(angle)
    layout[i] = {"x": x, "y": y}

# Convert the layout to JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(layout, indent=4)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Central Node Placement**: Node 0 is placed at the origin `(0, 0)`.
2. **Circular Placement**: The remaining nodes are placed at equal angular intervals around the central node. The angle between each node is calculated as `(2 * pi) / (num_nodes - 1)`.
3. **Radius**: The distance from the central node to any other node is set to `100.0` (you can adjust this value as needed).
4. **JSON Output**: The layout is stored in a dictionary and then converted to JSON format.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node ID, and the value is a dictionary containing the `x` and `y` coordinates of the node.

```json
{
    "0": {
        "x": 0.0,
        "y": 0.0
    },
    "1": {
        "x": 100.0,
        "y": 0.0
    },
    "2": {
        "x": 98.48077530122081,
        "y": 17.36522546726588
    },
    "3": {
        "x": 94.09521840226516,
        "y": 34.20201433256689
    },
    ...
    "28": {
        "x": 98.48077530122081,
        "y": -17.36522546726588
    }
}
```

This layout ensures that the Euclidean distance between the central node and any other node is consistent with the graph-theoretic distance, which is 1 for all edges.
