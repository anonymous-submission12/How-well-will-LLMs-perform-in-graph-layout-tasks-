To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a simple approach where we place the central node (node 0) at the origin and place the other nodes at equal distances around it in a circular fashion. This ensures that the Euclidean distance between the central node and each of the other nodes is the same, and the graph-theoretic distance (which is 1 for all edges) is also consistent.

Here is the Python code to generate the layout:

```python
import math
import json

# Input edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), 
             (0, 11), (0, 12), (0, 13), (0, 14), (0, 15), (0, 16), (0, 17), (0, 18), (0, 19), 
             (0, 20), (0, 21)]

# Number of nodes
num_nodes = len(edge_list) + 1

# Radius of the circle
radius = 100.0

# Calculate the angle between each node
angle_increment = (2 * math.pi) / (num_nodes - 1)

# Initialize the layout dictionary
layout = {}

# Place the central node at the origin
layout[0] = (0.0, 0.0)

# Place the other nodes in a circular fashion around the central node
for i in range(1, num_nodes):
    angle = (i - 1) * angle_increment
    x = radius * math.cos(angle)
    y = radius * math.sin(angle)
    layout[i] = (x, y)

# Convert the layout to JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(layout, indent=4)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Central Node Placement**: The central node (node 0) is placed at the origin `(0.0, 0.0)`.
2. **Circular Placement**: The other nodes are placed at equal angles around the central node, forming a circle. The radius of the circle is set to `100.0`, but you can adjust this value as needed.
3. **Angle Calculation**: The angle between each node is calculated as `(2 * pi) / (num_nodes - 1)`, where `num_nodes` is the total number of nodes.
4. **JSON Output**: The layout is converted to JSON format and printed.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node ID, and the value is a tuple representing the `(x, y)` coordinates of the node.

This layout ensures that the Euclidean distance between the central node and each of the other nodes is consistent, and the graph-theoretic distance is also maintained.
