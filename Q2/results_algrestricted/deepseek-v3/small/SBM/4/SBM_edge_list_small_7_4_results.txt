To generate a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear, we can use a community detection algorithm to divide the graph into communities and then assign positions to the nodes based on their community membership. Here, we will use the Louvain method for community detection and then assign positions to nodes in a circular layout within their respective communities.

Below is the Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import json
import random
import math
from collections import defaultdict

# Define the graph as an edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 15), 
             (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), 
             (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), 
             (7, 12), (7, 13), (8, 9), (8, 11), (8, 12), (9, 10), (9, 11), 
             (9, 12), (9, 13), (10, 13), (11, 12), (12, 13), (12, 15), 
             (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18), (15, 16), (15, 18), 
             (15, 19), (15, 20), (16, 17), (16, 20), (17, 18), (17, 19), 
             (17, 20), (18, 19), (19, 20)]

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented as a dictionary where each key is a node, and the value is a list of its neighbors.
2. **Community Detection**: The Louvain method is used to detect communities in the graph. This algorithm iteratively moves nodes between communities to maximize modularity.
3. **Position Assignment**: Nodes within the same community are placed in a circular layout around a central point. The central points of different communities are also arranged in a circular pattern to ensure that communities are visually distinct.
4. **Output**: The final layout is output in JSON format, where each node is mapped to its `(x, y)` position.

This script does not use any existing graph layout algorithms or visualization libraries, and it outputs the layout in JSON format as required.
