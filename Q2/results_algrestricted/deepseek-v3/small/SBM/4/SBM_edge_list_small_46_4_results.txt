To generate a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear, we can use a community detection algorithm to partition the graph into communities and then assign positions to the nodes based on their community membership. Here, we will use the Louvain method for community detection, which is a popular algorithm for detecting communities in large networks.

The layout will be generated by placing nodes in a circular fashion around the center of their respective communities. The communities themselves will be placed in a circular layout around the center of the graph.

Below is the Python code to achieve this:

```python
import json
import random
import math
from collections import defaultdict

# Function to detect communities using the Louvain method
def louvain_communities(edge_list):
    # Create a graph from the edge list
    graph = defaultdict(set)
    for u, v in edge_list:
        graph[u].add(v)
        graph[v].add(u)
    
    # Initialize communities
    communities = {node: i for i, node in enumerate(graph)}
    
    # Louvain method implementation (simplified)
    def modularity(graph, communities):
        m = sum(len(neighbors) for neighbors in graph.values()) / 2
        q = 0.0
        for node in graph:
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if communities[node] == communities[neighbor]:
                    q += 1 - (len(graph[node]) * len(graph[neighbor])) / (2 * m)
        return q / (2 * m)
    
    # Iteratively optimize communities
    improvement = True
    while improvement:
        improvement = False
        for node in graph:
            best_community = communities[node]
            best_gain = 0
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                new_community = communities[neighbor]
                if new_community != best_community:
                    old_q = modularity(graph, communities)
                    communities[node] = new_community
                    new_q = modularity(graph, communities)
                    gain = new_q - old_q
                    if gain > best_gain:
                        best_gain = gain
                        best_community = new_community
                    communities[node] = best_community
            if best_gain > 0:
                improvement = True
    
    # Convert communities to a list of sets
    community_dict = defaultdict(set)
    for node, community in communities.items():
        community_dict[community].add(node)
    return list(community_dict.values())

# Function to generate positions for nodes based on communities
def generate_layout(edge_list):
    communities = louvain_communities(edge_list)
    
    # Calculate the center of the graph
    center_x, center_y = 0, 0
    
    # Assign positions to nodes based on their community
    positions = {}
    for i, community in enumerate(communities):
        angle = 2 * math.pi * i / len(communities)
        community_center_x = center_x + 200 * math.cos(angle)
        community_center_y = center_y + 200 * math.sin(angle)
        
        # Assign positions to nodes in the community
        for j, node in enumerate(community):
            node_angle = 2 * math.pi * j / len(community)
            positions[node] = {
                "x": community_center_x + 50 * math.cos(node_angle),
                "y": community_center_y + 50 * math.sin(node_angle)
            }
    
    return positions

# Example usage
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 12), (0, 17), (0, 19), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (4, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 10), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 17), (8, 9), (8, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), (12, 13), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (15, 16), (15, 17), (16, 17), (18, 20), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 21), (20, 21), (21, 22)]

layout = generate_layout(edge_list)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Community Detection**: The `louvain_communities` function detects communities using a simplified version of the Louvain method. It iteratively optimizes the modularity of the graph by moving nodes between communities.

2. **Layout Generation**: The `generate_layout` function assigns positions to nodes based on their community membership. Each community is placed in a circular layout around the center of the graph, and nodes within each community are also placed in a circular layout around the center of their community.

3. **Output**: The final layout is output in JSON format, where each node is assigned an `(x, y)` position.

This code does not use any existing graph layout algorithms or visualization libraries, and it outputs the layout in JSON format as requested.
