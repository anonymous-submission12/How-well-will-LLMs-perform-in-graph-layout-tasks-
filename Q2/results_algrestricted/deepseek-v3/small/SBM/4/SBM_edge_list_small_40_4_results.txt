To generate a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear, we can use a community detection algorithm to partition the graph into communities and then assign positions to the nodes based on their community membership. Here, we will use the Louvain method for community detection, which is a popular algorithm for detecting communities in large networks.

The layout will be generated by placing nodes within the same community close to each other, while keeping different communities separated. The positions will be assigned in a grid-like fashion, with each community occupying a distinct region.

Below is the Python code to achieve this:

```python
import json
import random
from collections import defaultdict

# Define the graph as an edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 11), 
             (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 10), (3, 17), (4, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), 
             (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 11), (8, 9), (8, 10), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 14), 
             (11, 15), (12, 13), (12, 15), (12, 16), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 16), 
             (14, 15), (14, 16), (15, 16), (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 20), (17, 21), 
             (18, 19), (18, 20), (20, 21)]

# Function to detect communities using the Louvain method
def louvain_communities(edge_list):
    from community import community_louvain
    import networkx as nx
    
    G = nx.Graph()
    G.add_edges_from(edge_list)
    partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)
    
    # Create a dictionary to map nodes to their communities
    communities = defaultdict(list)
    for node, community_id in partition.items():
        communities[community_id].append(node)
    
    return list(communities.values())

# Function to generate positions for nodes based on communities
def generate_layout(communities):
    layout = {}
    community_spacing = 100  # Spacing between communities
    node_spacing = 20  # Spacing between nodes within a community
    
    for i, community in enumerate(communities):
        x_offset = i * community_spacing
        y_offset = 0
        
        for node in community:
            layout[node] = {
                'x': x_offset + random.uniform(-node_spacing, node_spacing),
                'y': y_offset + random.uniform(-node_spacing, node_spacing)
            }
            y_offset += node_spacing
    
    return layout

# Detect communities
communities = louvain_communities(edge_list)

# Generate layout
layout = generate_layout(communities)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Community Detection**: The `louvain_communities` function uses the Louvain method to detect communities in the graph. It returns a list of communities, where each community is a list of nodes.

2. **Layout Generation**: The `generate_layout` function assigns positions to nodes based on their community membership. Nodes within the same community are placed close to each other, while different communities are spaced apart.

3. **Output**: The final layout is output in JSON format, where each node is mapped to its `(x, y)` position.

### Note:
- The `community` module used in the code is part of the `python-louvain` package, which you can install using `pip install python-louvain`.
- The positions are generated with some randomness to avoid overlapping nodes within the same community. You can adjust the `node_spacing` and `community_spacing` variables to control the layout.

This code does not use any existing graph layout algorithms like `nx.spring_layout()` or `nx.circular_layout()`, and it does not use `matplotlib` or `networkx` for visualization. The output is purely the layout in JSON format.
