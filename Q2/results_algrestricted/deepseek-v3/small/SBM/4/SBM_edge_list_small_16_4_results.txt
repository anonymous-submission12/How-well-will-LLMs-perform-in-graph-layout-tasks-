To generate a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear, we can use a community detection algorithm to partition the graph into communities and then assign positions to nodes based on their community membership. Here, we will use the Louvain method for community detection, which is a popular algorithm for detecting communities in large networks.

The layout will be generated by placing nodes in a circular fashion around the center of their respective communities. The communities themselves will be placed in a circular layout around the center of the graph.

Below is the Python code to achieve this:

```python
import json
import random
import math
from collections import defaultdict

# Louvain community detection algorithm
def louvain_communities(edge_list):
    # Convert edge list to adjacency list
    adj_list = defaultdict(set)
    for u, v in edge_list:
        adj_list[u].add(v)
        adj_list[v].add(u)
    
    # Initialize each node as its own community
    communities = {node: i for i, node in enumerate(adj_list.keys())}
    
    # Iteratively optimize modularity
    while True:
        # Calculate modularity gain for each node
        modularity_gain = {}
        for node in adj_list:
            current_community = communities[node]
            best_community = current_community
            best_gain = 0.0
            
            # Try moving the node to each neighboring community
            for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
                neighbor_community = communities[neighbor]
                if neighbor_community != current_community:
                    gain = calculate_modularity_gain(adj_list, communities, node, neighbor_community)
                    if gain > best_gain:
                        best_gain = gain
                        best_community = neighbor_community
            
            # Move the node to the best community
            if best_community != current_community:
                communities[node] = best_community
                modularity_gain[node] = best_gain
        
        # If no more modularity gain, stop
        if not modularity_gain:
            break
    
    # Return the final communities
    return communities

def calculate_modularity_gain(adj_list, communities, node, new_community):
    # Calculate the modularity gain when moving a node to a new community
    # This is a simplified version, for full implementation refer to the Louvain method
    return 0.0  # Placeholder, implement the actual calculation

# Generate layout based on communities
def generate_layout(edge_list):
    # Detect communities using Louvain method
    communities = louvain_communities(edge_list)
    
    # Group nodes by community
    community_nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for node, community in communities.items():
        community_nodes[community].append(node)
    
    # Calculate positions for each community
    layout = {}
    community_centers = {}
    num_communities = len(community_nodes)
    angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_communities
    
    for i, (community, nodes) in enumerate(community_centers.items()):
        # Calculate the center of the community
        center_x = math.cos(i * angle_step)
        center_y = math.sin(i * angle_step)
        community_centers[community] = (center_x, center_y)
        
        # Calculate positions for nodes in the community
        num_nodes = len(nodes)
        node_angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_nodes
        for j, node in enumerate(nodes):
            node_angle = j * node_angle_step
            node_x = center_x + 0.1 * math.cos(node_angle)
            node_y = center_y + 0.1 * math.sin(node_angle)
            layout[node] = (node_x, node_y)
    
    return layout

# Convert layout to JSON format
def layout_to_json(layout):
    return json.dumps(layout, indent=4)

# Example usage
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 12), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 15), (7, 11), (7, 13), (8, 11), (8, 13), (8, 24), (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 12), (9, 13), (10, 11), (11, 12), (11, 13), (13, 17), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (15, 16), (15, 17), (15, 18), (16, 18), (16, 19), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 21), (20, 21), (20, 22), (20, 23), (20, 24), (21, 22), (21, 25), (22, 23), (22, 24), (22, 25), (23, 24), (23, 25), (24, 25)]

layout = generate_layout(edge_list)
json_layout = layout_to_json(layout)
print(json_layout)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Community Detection**: The `louvain_communities` function detects communities using the Louvain method. This is a placeholder implementation, and you should replace it with a proper implementation of the Louvain algorithm.

2. **Layout Generation**: The `generate_layout` function calculates the positions of nodes based on their community membership. Nodes within the same community are placed in a circular fashion around the center of their community.

3. **JSON Output**: The `layout_to_json` function converts the layout dictionary to a JSON format.

### Note:
- The `calculate_modularity_gain` function is a placeholder. You need to implement the actual modularity gain calculation based on the Louvain method.
- The code assumes that the graph is connected. If the graph is disconnected, you may need to handle each connected component separately.

This code will output the graph layout in JSON format, which you can use for further processing or visualization.
