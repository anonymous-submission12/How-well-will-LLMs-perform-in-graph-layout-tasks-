To generate a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear, we can use a community detection algorithm to partition the graph into communities and then assign positions to the nodes based on their community membership. Here, we will use the Louvain method for community detection, which is a popular algorithm for detecting communities in large networks.

The layout will be generated by placing nodes within the same community close to each other, while keeping different communities separated. The positions will be assigned in a grid-like fashion, with each community occupying a distinct region.

Here is the Python script to achieve this:

```python
import json
import random
from collections import defaultdict

# Define the graph as an edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 11), 
             (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 11), (6, 13), (7, 10), (7, 11), 
             (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), (12, 13), 
             (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17), (13, 15), (13, 17), (13, 25), 
             (14, 15), (14, 17), (15, 16), (15, 17), (15, 22), (16, 17), 
             (18, 19), (18, 21), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 21), (20, 22), 
             (23, 24), (23, 25), (23, 26), (23, 27), (24, 25), (24, 26), 
             (24, 27), (25, 26), (25, 27), (26, 27)]

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented as a dictionary where each key is a node, and the value is a list of its neighbors.
2. **Community Detection**: The Louvain method is used to detect communities in the graph. This algorithm iteratively optimizes the modularity of the graph by moving nodes between communities.
3. **Layout Generation**: Nodes within the same community are placed close to each other in a grid-like fashion. Each community is assigned a distinct region in the grid.
4. **Output**: The final layout is output in JSON format, where each node is assigned a position `(x, y)`.

This script does not use any existing graph layout algorithms or visualization libraries, and it outputs the layout in JSON format as required.
