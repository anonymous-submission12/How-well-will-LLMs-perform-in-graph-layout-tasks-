To generate a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear, we can use a community detection algorithm to divide the graph into communities and then assign positions to the nodes based on their community membership. Here, we will use the Louvain method for community detection, which is a popular algorithm for detecting communities in large networks.

The layout will be generated by placing nodes in a circular fashion within their respective communities, and then positioning the communities themselves in a circular layout to ensure clarity.

Here is the Python script to achieve this:

```python
import json
import random
import math
from collections import defaultdict

# Function to detect communities using the Louvain method
def louvain_communities(edges):
    # Create a graph from the edge list
    graph = defaultdict(set)
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].add(v)
        graph[v].add(u)
    
    # Initialize communities
    communities = {node: i for i, node in enumerate(graph)}
    
    # Function to compute modularity
    def compute_modularity(graph, communities):
        m = sum(len(neighbors) for neighbors in graph.values()) / 2
        q = 0.0
        for node in graph:
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if communities[node] == communities[neighbor]:
                    q += 1 - (len(graph[node]) * len(graph[neighbor])) / (2 * m)
        return q / (2 * m)
    
    # Louvain algorithm
    improvement = True
    while improvement:
        improvement = False
        for node in graph:
            best_community = communities[node]
            best_gain = 0
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if communities[neighbor] != communities[node]:
                    original_community = communities[node]
                    communities[node] = communities[neighbor]
                    gain = compute_modularity(graph, communities) - compute_modularity(graph, communities)
                    if gain > best_gain:
                        best_gain = gain
                        best_community = communities[neighbor]
                    communities[node] = original_community
            if best_gain > 0:
                communities[node] = best_community
                improvement = True
    
    # Group nodes by community
    community_nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for node, community in communities.items():
        community_nodes[community].append(node)
    
    return community_nodes

# Function to generate positions for nodes in a circular layout
def circular_layout(nodes, radius, center):
    positions = {}
    angle = 2 * math.pi / len(nodes)
    for i, node in enumerate(nodes):
        x = center[0] + radius * math.cos(i * angle)
        y = center[1] + radius * math.sin(i * angle)
        positions[node] = (x, y)
    return positions

# Function to generate the graph layout
def generate_layout(edges):
    # Detect communities
    community_nodes = louvain_communities(edges)
    
    # Generate positions for each community
    layout = {}
    community_centers = {}
    community_radius = 100  # Radius for each community's circle
    main_radius = 300  # Radius for the main circle
    
    # Calculate the center for each community
    num_communities = len(community_nodes)
    angle = 2 * math.pi / num_communities
    for i, (community, nodes) in enumerate(community_nodes.items()):
        x = main_radius * math.cos(i * angle)
        y = main_radius * math.sin(i * angle)
        community_centers[community] = (x, y)
    
    # Assign positions to nodes within each community
    for community, nodes in community_nodes.items():
        center = community_centers[community]
        positions = circular_layout(nodes, community_radius, center)
        layout.update(positions)
    
    return layout

# Edge list of the graph
edges = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 11), (0, 13), (0, 14), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 19), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 18), (5, 6), (5, 9), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 12), (7, 13), (8, 9), (8, 11), (8, 12), (8, 13), (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 12), (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 13), (10, 14), (11, 12), (11, 13), (12, 13), (14, 15), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (14, 20), (15, 16), (15, 17), (15, 18), (15, 20), (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 19), (16, 20), (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 20), (18, 19), (18, 20)]

### Explanation:
1. **Community Detection**: The `louvain_communities` function detects communities using the Louvain method. It iteratively optimizes the modularity of the graph by moving nodes between communities.

2. **Circular Layout**: The `circular_layout` function places nodes in a circular fashion within their respective communities. The radius and center of each community's circle are determined based on the main circle's radius.

3. **Layout Generation**: The `generate_layout` function combines the community detection and circular layout generation to create a layout where each community is positioned in a circular fashion around a main circle.

4. **Output**: The final layout is output in JSON format, which can be used for further processing or visualization.

This script ensures that the community structure is clear by grouping nodes within their communities and positioning the communities themselves in a circular layout.
