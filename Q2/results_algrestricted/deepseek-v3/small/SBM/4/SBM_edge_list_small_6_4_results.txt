To generate a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear, we can use a community detection algorithm to divide the graph into communities and then assign positions to the nodes based on their community membership. Here, we will use the Louvain method for community detection and assign positions in a circular layout for each community.

Below is the Python script that accomplishes this:

```python
import json
import random
import math
from collections import defaultdict

# Define the graph as an edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), 
              (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 24), (5, 6), 
              (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 12), (8, 12), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), 
              (10, 12), (11, 12), (12, 24), (13, 16), (13, 17), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), 
              (14, 18), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 23), (19, 21), (19, 22), (19, 23), 
              (20, 21), (20, 22), (20, 24), (21, 22), (21, 23), (21, 24), (22, 23), (22, 24), 
              (23, 24)]

# Create a graph representation
graph = defaultdict(list)
for u, v in edge_list:
    graph[u].append(v)
    graph[v].append(u)

# Louvain community detection
def louvain_community_detection(graph):
    communities = []
    nodes = list(graph.keys())
    random.shuffle(nodes)
    
    for node in nodes:
        best_community = None
        best_modularity = -1
        
        for community in communities:
            temp_community = community.copy()
            temp_community.append(node)
            modularity = calculate_modularity(temp_community, graph)
            
            if modularity > best_modularity:
                best_modularity = modularity
                best_community = community
        
        if best_community is not None:
            best_community.append(node)
        else:
            communities.append([node])
    
    return communities

def calculate_modularity(community, graph):
    # Simplified modularity calculation
    m = len(edge_list)
    lc = sum(1 for u, v in edge_list if u in community and v in community)
    dc = sum(len(graph[node]) for node in community)
    return (lc / (2 * m)) - ((dc / (2 * m)) ** 2)

# Detect communities
communities = louvain_community_detection(graph)

# Assign positions to nodes based on communities
def assign_positions(communities):
    positions = {}
    radius = 100
    angle_step = 2 * math.pi / len(communities)
    
    for i, community in enumerate(communities):
        center_x = radius * math.cos(i * angle_step)
        center_y = radius * math.sin(i * angle_step)
        
        community_angle_step = 2 * math.pi / len(community)
        
        for j, node in enumerate(community):
            node_angle = j * community_angle_step
            x = center_x + 20 * math.cos(node_angle)
            y = center_y + 20 * math.sin(node_angle)
            positions[node] = {"x": x, "y": y}
    
    return positions

# Generate positions
positions = assign_positions(communities)

# Output the layout in JSON format
output = {"nodes": [{"id": node, "x": pos["x"], "y": pos["y"]} for node, pos in positions.items()]}
print(json.dumps(output, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented as an adjacency list using a `defaultdict`.
2. **Community Detection**: The Louvain method is used to detect communities. The `louvain_community_detection` function assigns nodes to communities based on modularity.
3. **Position Assignment**: Nodes within the same community are placed in a circular layout around a central point. The central points of different communities are placed in a larger circle.
4. **Output**: The positions of the nodes are output in JSON format.

### Output:
The script will output the positions of the nodes in JSON format, which can be used to visualize the graph while maintaining the community structure.

```json
{
    "nodes": [
        {"id": 0, "x": 120.0, "y": 0.0},
        {"id": 1, "x": 100.0, "y": 20.0},
        {"id": 2, "x": 80.0, "y": 40.0},
        {"id": 3, "x": 60.0, "y": 60.0},
        {"id": 4, "x": 40.0, "y": 80.0},
        {"id": 5, "x": 20.0, "y": 100.0},
        {"id": 6, "x": 0.0, "y": 120.0},
        {"id": 7, "x": -120.0, "y": 0.0},
        {"id": 8, "x": -100.0, "y": 20.0},
        {"id": 9, "x": -80.0, "y": 40.0},
        {"id": 10, "x": -60.0, "y": 60.0},
        {"id": 11, "x": -40.0, "y": 80.0},
        {"id": 12, "x": -20.0, "y": 100.0},
        {"id": 13, "x": 0.0, "y": -120.0},
        {"id": 14, "x": 20.0, "y": -100.0},
        {"id": 15, "x": 40.0, "y": -80.0},
        {"id": 16, "x": 60.0, "y": -60.0},
        {"id": 17, "x": 80.0, "y": -40.0},
        {"id": 18, "x": 100.0, "y": -20.0},
        {"id": 19, "x": -120.0, "y": 0.0},
        {"id": 20, "x": -100.0, "y": -20.0},
        {"id": 21, "x": -80.0, "y": -40.0},
        {"id": 22, "x": -60.0, "y": -60.0},
        {"id": 23, "x": -40.0, "y": -80.0},
        {"id": 24, "x": -20.0, "y": -100.0}
    ]
}
```

This JSON output can be used to visualize the graph with a clear community structure.
