To generate a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear, we can use a community detection algorithm to partition the graph into communities and then assign positions to the nodes based on their community membership. Here, we will use the Louvain method for community detection, which is a popular algorithm for detecting communities in large networks.

The layout will be generated by placing nodes in a circular fashion around the center of their respective communities. The communities themselves will be placed in a circular layout around the center of the graph.

Here is the Python code to achieve this:

```python
import json
import random
import math
from collections import defaultdict

# Edge list of the graph
edge_list = [(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 15), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), (3, 11), (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 11), (5, 7), (5, 9), (5, 10), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 23), (8, 9), (8, 10), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), (12, 14), (12, 16), (12, 18), (12, 19), (12, 21), (12, 22), (12, 23), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (13, 18), (13, 19), (13, 20), (13, 23), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (14, 20), (14, 22), (14, 23), (15, 18), (15, 19), (15, 20), (15, 21), (15, 23), (16, 18), (16, 19), (16, 20), (16, 22), (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 20), (17, 21), (17, 22), (17, 23), (18, 19), (18, 20), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 21), (19, 22), (19, 23), (20, 21), (20, 22), (20, 23), (21, 23), (22, 23)]

# Function to detect communities using the Louvain method
def louvain_communities(edge_list):
    import community as community_louvain
    import networkx as nx
    G = nx.Graph()
    G.add_edges_from(edge_list)
    partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)
    return partition

# Function to generate positions for nodes based on their communities
def generate_layout(edge_list):
    partition = louvain_communities(edge_list)
    
    # Group nodes by their community
    communities = defaultdict(list)
    for node, community in partition.items():
        communities[community].append(node)
    
    # Calculate the number of communities
    num_communities = len(communities)
    
    # Calculate the angle between communities
    angle_between_communities = 2 * math.pi / num_communities
    
    # Generate positions for each community
    layout = {}
    for i, (community, nodes) in enumerate(communities.items()):
        # Calculate the center of the community
        center_angle = i * angle_between_communities
        center_x = math.cos(center_angle) * 100
        center_y = math.sin(center_angle) * 100
        
        # Calculate the angle between nodes in the community
        angle_between_nodes = 2 * math.pi / len(nodes)
        
        # Generate positions for each node in the community
        for j, node in enumerate(nodes):
            node_angle = j * angle_between_nodes
            node_x = center_x + math.cos(node_angle) * 30
            node_y = center_y + math.sin(node_angle) * 30
            layout[node] = (node_x, node_y)
    
    return layout

# Generate the layout
layout = generate_layout(edge_list)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Community Detection**: The `louvain_communities` function uses the Louvain method to detect communities in the graph. This function returns a dictionary where each node is mapped to its community.

2. **Layout Generation**: The `generate_layout` function generates positions for each node based on its community. Communities are placed in a circular layout around the center of the graph, and nodes within each community are also placed in a circular layout around the center of their respective community.

3. **Output**: The final layout is output in JSON format, where each node is mapped to its (x, y) position.

### Note:
- The `community` module used in the `louvain_communities` function is part of the `python-louvain` package, which can be installed via `pip install python-louvain`.
- The positions are generated in a way that keeps the community structure clear by placing communities and nodes within communities in a circular fashion.

This code does not use any existing graph layout algorithms like `nx.spring_layout()` or `nx.circular_layout()`, and it does not use `matplotlib` or `networkx` to draw the graph visually. The final output is the graph layout in JSON format.
