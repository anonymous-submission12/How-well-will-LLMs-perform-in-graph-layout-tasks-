To generate a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear, we can use a community detection algorithm to partition the graph into communities and then assign positions to the nodes based on their community membership. Here, we will use the Louvain method for community detection, which is a popular algorithm for detecting communities in large networks.

The layout will be generated by placing nodes in a circular arrangement around the center of the graph, with nodes in the same community placed closer together. The positions will be stored in a JSON format.

Here is the Python script to achieve this:

```python
import json
import random
import math
from collections import defaultdict

# Edge list of the graph
edge_list = [(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 11), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), (3, 11), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (5, 10), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (9, 11), (9, 22), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17), (12, 18), (12, 19), (12, 20), (12, 21), (12, 22), (12, 23), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 18), (13, 19), (13, 20), (13, 22), (13, 23), (14, 15), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (14, 20), (14, 22), (14, 23), (15, 16), (15, 17), (15, 18), (15, 19), (15, 22), (15, 23), (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 19), (16, 22), (16, 23), (17, 19), (17, 20), (17, 21), (17, 22), (17, 23), (18, 20), (18, 21), (18, 23), (19, 21), (19, 23), (20, 21), (20, 22), (21, 22), (21, 23)]

# Function to detect communities using the Louvain method
def louvain_communities(edge_list):
    from community import community_louvain
    import networkx as nx

    G = nx.Graph()
    G.add_edges_from(edge_list)
    partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)
    return partition

# Function to generate positions for nodes based on communities
def generate_layout(edge_list):
    partition = louvain_communities(edge_list)
    
    # Group nodes by community
    communities = defaultdict(list)
    for node, community_id in partition.items():
        communities[community_id].append(node)
    
    # Calculate positions for each community
    layout = {}
    center = (0, 0)
    radius = 100
    angle_step = 2 * math.pi / len(communities)
    
    for i, (community_id, nodes) in enumerate(communities.items()):
        community_center = (
            center[0] + radius * math.cos(i * angle_step),
            center[1] + radius * math.sin(i * angle_step)
        )
        
        # Place nodes in a circle around the community center
        node_angle_step = 2 * math.pi / len(nodes)
        for j, node in enumerate(nodes):
            layout[node] = {
                "x": community_center[0] + 20 * math.cos(j * node_angle_step),
                "y": community_center[1] + 20 * math.sin(j * node_angle_step)
            }
    
    return layout

# Generate the layout
layout = generate_layout(edge_list)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Community Detection**: The `louvain_communities` function uses the Louvain method to detect communities in the graph. This function returns a dictionary where each node is mapped to its community ID.

2. **Layout Generation**: The `generate_layout` function calculates the positions for each node based on its community. Nodes in the same community are placed in a circular arrangement around a central point, which is itself placed in a circular arrangement around the center of the graph.

3. **Output**: The final layout is output in JSON format, where each node is mapped to its `(x, y)` coordinates.

### Dependencies:
- The script uses the `community` library for the Louvain method. You can install it using `pip install python-louvain`.
- The script also uses `networkx` for graph manipulation, which can be installed using `pip install networkx`.

### Note:
- The positions are calculated using basic trigonometry to place nodes in a circular arrangement. The radius and angle steps can be adjusted to change the spacing between nodes and communities.
- The script does not use any existing graph layout algorithms like `nx.spring_layout()` or `nx.circular_layout()`, as per the requirements.
