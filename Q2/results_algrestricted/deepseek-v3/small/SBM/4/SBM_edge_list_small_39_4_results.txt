To generate a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear, we can use a community detection algorithm to partition the graph into communities and then assign positions to the nodes based on their community membership. Here, I'll use the Louvain method for community detection and then assign positions in a circular layout for each community.

Below is the Python code that accomplishes this:

```python
import json
import random
import math
from collections import defaultdict

# Louvain method for community detection
def louvain_communities(edges):
    # Initialize each node as its own community
    communities = {node: i for i, node in enumerate(set([n for edge in edges for n in edge]))}
    
    # Function to calculate modularity
    def modularity(communities, edges):
        m = len(edges)
        degrees = defaultdict(int)
        for u, v in edges:
            degrees[u] += 1
            degrees[v] += 1
        q = 0
        for u, v in edges:
            if communities[u] == communities[v]:
                q += 1 - (degrees[u] * degrees[v]) / (2 * m)
        return q / (2 * m)
    
    # Iteratively optimize communities
    improved = True
    while improved:
        improved = False
        for node in communities:
            best_community = communities[node]
            best_q = modularity(communities, edges)
            for neighbor in [v for u, v in edges if u == node] + [u for u, v in edges if v == node]:
                original_community = communities[node]
                communities[node] = communities[neighbor]
                new_q = modularity(communities, edges)
                if new_q > best_q:
                    best_q = new_q
                    best_community = communities[neighbor]
                else:
                    communities[node] = original_community
            if communities[node] != best_community:
                communities[node] = best_community
                improved = True
    return communities

# Function to generate positions for nodes in a circular layout
def circular_layout(communities):
    layout = {}
    community_nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for node, community in communities.items():
        community_nodes[community].append(node)
    
    for community, nodes in community_nodes.items():
        radius = len(nodes) * 10  # Adjust radius based on community size
        angle = 2 * math.pi / len(nodes)
        for i, node in enumerate(nodes):
            x = radius * math.cos(i * angle)
            y = radius * math.sin(i * angle)
            layout[node] = (x, y)
    
    return layout

# Main function to generate the layout
def generate_layout(edges):
    communities = louvain_communities(edges)
    layout = circular_layout(communities)
    return layout

# Example usage
edges = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 12), 
         (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (1, 11), 
         (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10), 
         (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 10), 
         (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 9), 
         (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 9), (5, 11), 
         (6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 11), 
         (7, 9), (7, 11), 
         (8, 9), (8, 11), 
         (9, 10), (9, 11), 
         (10, 11), (10, 12), 
         (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17), (12, 18), (12, 19), (12, 20), (12, 22), 
         (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (13, 18), (13, 20), (13, 21), 
         (14, 15), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (14, 20), (14, 22), 
         (15, 17), (15, 18), (15, 19), (15, 20), (15, 21), (15, 22), 
         (16, 18), (16, 20), (16, 21), (16, 22), 
         (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 22), 
         (18, 19), (18, 20), (18, 21), (18, 22), 
         (19, 22), (20, 22), (21, 22)]

layout = generate_layout(edges)

# Convert layout to JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(layout, indent=4)
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Community Detection**: The `louvain_communities` function uses the Louvain method to detect communities in the graph. It iteratively optimizes the modularity of the community structure.
2. **Circular Layout**: The `circular_layout` function assigns positions to nodes in a circular layout based on their community membership. Nodes within the same community are placed in a circle, and the radius of the circle is proportional to the size of the community.
3. **JSON Output**: The final layout is converted to JSON format, which can be used for further processing or visualization.

This code does not use any existing graph layout algorithms or visualization libraries, and it outputs the layout in JSON format as required.
