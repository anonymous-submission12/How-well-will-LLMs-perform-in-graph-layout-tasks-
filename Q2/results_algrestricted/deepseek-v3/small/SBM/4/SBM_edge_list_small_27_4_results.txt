To generate a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear, we can use a community detection algorithm to partition the graph into communities and then assign positions to the nodes based on their community membership. Here, we will use the Louvain method for community detection, which is a popular algorithm for detecting communities in large networks.

The layout will be generated by placing nodes within the same community close to each other, while keeping different communities separated. The positions will be assigned in a circular fashion around the center of the graph.

Here is the Python script to achieve this:

```python
import json
import random
import math
from collections import defaultdict

# Louvain community detection algorithm
def louvain_communities(edge_list):
    # Create a graph from the edge list
    graph = defaultdict(set)
    for u, v in edge_list:
        graph[u].add(v)
        graph[v].add(u)
    
    # Initialize each node as its own community
    communities = {node: i for i, node in enumerate(graph.keys())}
    
    # Iteratively optimize communities
    changed = True
    while changed:
        changed = False
        for node in graph:
            best_community = communities[node]
            best_modularity = modularity(graph, communities)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                original_community = communities[neighbor]
                communities[neighbor] = communities[node]
                new_modularity = modularity(graph, communities)
                if new_modularity > best_modularity:
                    best_modularity = new_modularity
                    best_community = original_community
                communities[neighbor] = original_community
            if best_community != communities[node]:
                communities[node] = best_community
                changed = True
    return communities

# Modularity calculation
def modularity(graph, communities):
    m = sum(len(neighbors) for neighbors in graph.values()) / 2
    q = 0.0
    for node in graph:
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if communities[node] == communities[neighbor]:
                q += 1 - (len(graph[node]) * len(graph[neighbor])) / (2 * m)
    return q / (2 * m)

# Generate layout based on communities
def generate_layout(edge_list):
    communities = louvain_communities(edge_list)
    
    # Group nodes by community
    community_nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for node, community in communities.items():
        community_nodes[community].append(node)
    
    # Assign positions to nodes based on their community
    layout = {}
    num_communities = len(community_nodes)
    angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_communities
    radius = 100.0  # Radius of the circle for community centers
    
    for i, (community, nodes) in enumerate(community_nodes.items()):
        center_x = radius * math.cos(i * angle_step)
        center_y = radius * math.sin(i * angle_step)
        
        # Assign positions within the community
        num_nodes = len(nodes)
        node_angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_nodes
        node_radius = 20.0  # Radius for nodes within a community
        
        for j, node in enumerate(nodes):
            node_x = center_x + node_radius * math.cos(j * node_angle_step)
            node_y = center_y + node_radius * math.sin(j * node_angle_step)
            layout[node] = (node_x, node_y)
    
    return layout

# Edge list of the graph
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 16), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 11), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 27), (5, 16), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (9, 10), (9, 11), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 16), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 17), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (15, 16), (15, 17), (16, 17), (16, 19), (18, 19), (18, 21), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 22), (20, 21), (20, 22), (23, 27), (24, 26), (24, 27), (25, 26), (25, 27), (26, 27)]

# Generate the layout
layout = generate_layout(edge_list)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))

### Explanation:
1. **Community Detection**: The `louvain_communities` function uses the Louvain method to detect communities in the graph. It iteratively optimizes the community assignments to maximize modularity.
2. **Layout Generation**: The `generate_layout` function assigns positions to nodes based on their community. Nodes within the same community are placed close to each other in a circular pattern around the community's center.
3. **Output**: The final layout is output in JSON format, where each node is mapped to its (x, y) coordinates.

This script does not use any existing graph layout algorithms or visualization libraries, and it outputs the layout in JSON format as required.
