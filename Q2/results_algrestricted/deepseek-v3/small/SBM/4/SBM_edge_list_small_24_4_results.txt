To generate a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear, we can use a community detection algorithm to partition the graph into communities and then assign positions to the nodes based on their community membership. Here, we will use the Louvain method for community detection, which is a popular algorithm for detecting communities in large networks.

The layout will be generated by placing nodes in a circular layout within their respective communities, and then positioning the communities themselves in a circular layout around the center of the graph.

Below is the Python code to achieve this:

```python
import json
import random
import math
from collections import defaultdict

# Louvain community detection algorithm
def louvain_communities(edges):
    # Create a graph from the edge list
    graph = defaultdict(set)
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].add(v)
        graph[v].add(u)
    
    # Initialize each node as its own community
    communities = {node: i for i, node in enumerate(graph)}
    
    # Function to calculate modularity
    def modularity(graph, communities):
        m = sum(len(neighbors) for neighbors in graph.values()) / 2
        q = 0.0
        for node in graph:
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if communities[node] == communities[neighbor]:
                    q += 1 - (len(graph[node]) * len(graph[neighbor])) / (2 * m)
        return q / (2 * m)
    
    # Iteratively optimize communities
    while True:
        improvement = False
        for node in graph:
            best_community = communities[node]
            best_gain = 0
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                new_community = communities[neighbor]
                if new_community != best_community:
                    old_q = modularity(graph, communities)
                    communities[node] = new_community
                    new_q = modularity(graph, communities)
                    gain = new_q - old_q
                    if gain > best_gain:
                        best_gain = gain
                        best_community = new_community
                    communities[node] = best_community
            if best_gain > 0:
                improvement = True
        if not improvement:
            break
    
    # Group nodes by community
    community_nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for node, community in communities.items():
        community_nodes[community].append(node)
    
    return list(community_nodes.values())

# Generate positions for nodes within a community
def generate_community_layout(nodes, center, radius):
    positions = {}
    angle = 2 * math.pi / len(nodes)
    for i, node in enumerate(nodes):
        x = center[0] + radius * math.cos(i * angle)
        y = center[1] + radius * math.sin(i * angle)
        positions[node] = (x, y)
    return positions

# Generate the overall graph layout
def generate_graph_layout(edges):
    communities = louvain_communities(edges)
    
    # Calculate the center and radius for each community
    community_centers = []
    community_radius = 100  # Radius for each community
    overall_radius = 300  # Radius for the overall graph
    angle = 2 * math.pi / len(communities)
    
    for i, community in enumerate(communities):
        x = overall_radius * math.cos(i * angle)
        y = overall_radius * math.sin(i * angle)
        community_centers.append((x, y))
    
    # Generate positions for each node
    positions = {}
    for i, community in enumerate(communities):
        center = community_centers[i]
        community_positions = generate_community_layout(community, center, community_radius)
        positions.update(community_positions)
    
    return positions

# Example usage
edges = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 22), (5, 14), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 10), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), (10, 26), (12, 13), (12, 16), (12, 17), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (13, 25), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 19), (15, 16), (15, 17), (16, 17), (18, 19), (18, 20), (18, 21), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 21), (20, 21), (20, 22), (21, 22), (23, 24), (23, 25), (23, 26), (23, 27), (24, 26), (24, 27), (25, 26), (25, 27), (26, 27)]

layout = generate_graph_layout(edges)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Community Detection**: The `louvain_communities` function detects communities using the Louvain method. It iteratively optimizes the modularity of the graph by moving nodes between communities.

2. **Layout Generation**: The `generate_community_layout` function places nodes in a circular layout within their respective communities. The `generate_graph_layout` function then places these communities in a circular layout around the center of the graph.

3. **Output**: The final layout is output in JSON format, where each node is mapped to its (x, y) position.

This code does not use any existing graph layout algorithms or visualization libraries, and it outputs the layout in JSON format as required.
