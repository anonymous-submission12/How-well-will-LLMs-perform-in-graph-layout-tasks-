To generate a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear, we can use a community detection algorithm to partition the graph into communities and then assign positions to the nodes based on their community membership. Here, we will use the Louvain method for community detection, which is a popular algorithm for detecting communities in large networks.

The layout will be generated by placing nodes in a circular fashion within their respective communities, and then positioning the communities themselves in a circular layout to ensure clarity.

Below is the Python code to achieve this:

```python
import json
import random
import math
from collections import defaultdict

# Louvain community detection algorithm
def louvain_communities(edge_list):
    # Create a graph from the edge list
    graph = defaultdict(set)
    for u, v in edge_list:
        graph[u].add(v)
        graph[v].add(u)
    
    # Initialize each node as its own community
    communities = {node: i for i, node in enumerate(graph)}
    
    # Function to calculate modularity
    def modularity(graph, communities):
        m = sum(len(neighbors) for neighbors in graph.values()) / 2
        q = 0.0
        for node in graph:
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if communities[node] == communities[neighbor]:
                    q += 1 - (len(graph[node]) * len(graph[neighbor])) / (2 * m)
        return q / (2 * m)
    
    # Iteratively optimize communities
    improvement = True
    while improvement:
        improvement = False
        for node in graph:
            best_community = communities[node]
            best_gain = 0
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                new_community = communities[neighbor]
                if new_community != best_community:
                    old_q = modularity(graph, communities)
                    communities[node] = new_community
                    new_q = modularity(graph, communities)
                    gain = new_q - old_q
                    if gain > best_gain:
                        best_gain = gain
                        best_community = new_community
                    communities[node] = best_community
            if best_gain > 0:
                improvement = True
    
    # Group nodes by community
    community_dict = defaultdict(list)
    for node, community in communities.items():
        community_dict[community].append(node)
    
    return list(community_dict.values())

# Generate positions for nodes within communities
def generate_layout(edge_list):
    communities = louvain_communities(edge_list)
    
    # Calculate the number of communities
    num_communities = len(communities)
    
    # Calculate the angle between communities
    angle_between_communities = 2 * math.pi / num_communities
    
    # Generate positions for each community
    layout = {}
    for i, community in enumerate(communities):
        # Calculate the center of the community
        center_x = math.cos(i * angle_between_communities)
        center_y = math.sin(i * angle_between_communities)
        
        # Calculate the angle between nodes within the community
        angle_between_nodes = 2 * math.pi / len(community)
        
        # Generate positions for each node in the community
        for j, node in enumerate(community):
            radius = 0.1 * (j + 1)  # Adjust radius to spread nodes within the community
            x = center_x + radius * math.cos(j * angle_between_nodes)
            y = center_y + radius * math.sin(j * angle_between_nodes)
            layout[node] = {"x": x, "y": y}
    
    return layout

# Example usage
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 9), (0, 10), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 10), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), (3, 18), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 6), (5, 9), (5, 10), (6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 20), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (8, 9), (8, 10), (9, 20), (11, 12), (11, 13), (11, 14), (11, 17), (11, 18), (11, 19), (11, 20), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 18), (12, 19), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 17), (13, 19), (13, 20), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (14, 20), (15, 16), (15, 18), (15, 19), (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 19), (16, 20), (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 20), (18, 19), (18, 20), (19, 20)]

layout = generate_layout(edge_list)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Community Detection**: The `louvain_communities` function uses the Louvain method to detect communities in the graph. It iteratively optimizes the modularity of the graph by moving nodes between communities.

2. **Layout Generation**: The `generate_layout` function generates positions for nodes within their respective communities. Nodes within a community are placed in a circular fashion around the center of the community. The communities themselves are arranged in a circular layout to ensure clarity.

3. **Output**: The final layout is output in JSON format, where each node is assigned an `(x, y)` position.

### Note:
- The code does not use any existing graph layout algorithms like `nx.spring_layout()` or `nx.circular_layout()`.
- The layout is generated purely based on community detection and simple geometric calculations.
- The output is in JSON format, which can be used for further processing or visualization.
