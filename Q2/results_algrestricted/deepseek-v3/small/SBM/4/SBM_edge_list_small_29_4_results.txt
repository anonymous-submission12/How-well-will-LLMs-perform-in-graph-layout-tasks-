To generate a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear, we can use a community detection algorithm to partition the graph into communities and then assign positions to the nodes based on their community membership. Here, we will use the Louvain method for community detection, which is a popular algorithm for detecting communities in large networks.

The layout will be generated by placing nodes in a circular fashion within their respective communities, and then arranging the communities in a larger circle. This approach ensures that the community structure is visually clear.

Below is the Python code to achieve this:

```python
import json
import random
import math
from collections import defaultdict

# Edge list of the graph
edge_list = [(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 17), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 17), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 19), (8, 9), (8, 13), (8, 15), (9, 10), (9, 12), (9, 13), (9, 14), (9, 16), (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 13), (10, 15), (11, 12), (11, 13), (11, 14), (11, 15), (12, 13), (12, 14), (13, 14), (13, 15), (14, 15), (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 19), (16, 20), (16, 21), (16, 22), (17, 19), (17, 20), (17, 21), (17, 22), (18, 19), (18, 22), (19, 20), (20, 21)]

# Function to detect communities using the Louvain method
def louvain_communities(edge_list):
    import community as community_louvain
    import networkx as nx
    G = nx.Graph()
    G.add_edges_from(edge_list)
    partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)
    return partition

# Function to generate positions for nodes based on communities
def generate_layout(edge_list):
    partition = louvain_communities(edge_list)
    
    # Group nodes by community
    communities = defaultdict(list)
    for node, community in partition.items():
        communities[community].append(node)
    
    # Calculate positions for each community
    layout = {}
    community_positions = {}
    num_communities = len(communities)
    angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_communities
    radius = 100  # Radius for the main circle
    
    for i, (community, nodes) in enumerate(communities.items()):
        # Position of the community center
        center_x = radius * math.cos(i * angle_step)
        center_y = radius * math.sin(i * angle_step)
        community_positions[community] = (center_x, center_y)
        
        # Position nodes in a circle around the community center
        num_nodes = len(nodes)
        node_angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_nodes
        node_radius = 20  # Radius for the nodes within a community
        
        for j, node in enumerate(nodes):
            node_x = center_x + node_radius * math.cos(j * node_angle_step)
            node_y = center_y + node_radius * math.sin(j * node_angle_step)
            layout[node] = (node_x, node_y)
    
    return layout

# Generate the layout
layout = generate_layout(edge_list)

# Convert the layout to JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(layout, indent=4)
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Community Detection**: The `louvain_communities` function uses the Louvain method to detect communities in the graph. This function returns a dictionary where each node is mapped to its community.

2. **Layout Generation**: The `generate_layout` function calculates the positions for each node based on its community. Nodes within the same community are placed in a small circle around the community's center. The communities themselves are arranged in a larger circle.

3. **Output**: The final layout is converted to JSON format and printed.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node, and the value is a tuple representing the `(x, y)` coordinates of the node in the layout.

```json
{
    "0": [120.0, 0.0],
    "1": [100.0, 60.0],
    "2": [80.0, 120.0],
    ...
}
```

This JSON can be used to visualize the graph in any tool that accepts custom layouts.
