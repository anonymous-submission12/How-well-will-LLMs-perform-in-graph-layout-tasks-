To generate a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear, we can use a community detection algorithm to divide the graph into communities and then assign positions to the nodes based on their community membership. Here, we will use the Louvain method for community detection, which is a popular algorithm for detecting communities in large networks.

The layout will be generated by placing nodes in a circular fashion around the center of their respective communities. The communities themselves will be placed in a circular layout around the center of the graph.

Here is the Python code to achieve this:

```python
import json
import random
import math
from collections import defaultdict

# Define the graph as an edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 12), 
             (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9), (1, 11), (1, 12), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), 
             (2, 7), (2, 9), (2, 11), (2, 12), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), 
             (3, 12), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 11), (4, 12), (4, 24), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 9), 
             (5, 10), (5, 11), (5, 12), (5, 24), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 17), 
             (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 11), (7, 12), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (8, 12), (9, 11),

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Construction**: The graph is constructed from the provided edge list.
2. **Community Detection**: The Louvain method is used to detect communities in the graph. This algorithm iteratively optimizes the modularity of the graph by moving nodes between communities.
3. **Layout Generation**: Nodes are placed in a circular fashion around the center of their respective communities. The communities themselves are placed in a circular layout around the center of the graph.
4. **Output**: The layout is output in JSON format, where each node is mapped to its (x, y) coordinates.

This approach ensures that the community structure is visually clear in the generated layout.
