To generate a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear, we can use a community detection algorithm to partition the graph into communities and then assign positions to the nodes based on their community membership. Here, we will use the Louvain method for community detection, which is a popular algorithm for detecting communities in large networks.

The layout will be generated by placing nodes in a circular fashion within their respective communities, and then positioning the communities themselves in a circular layout to ensure clarity.

Below is the Python code to achieve this:

```python
import json
import random
import math
from collections import defaultdict

# Louvain community detection algorithm
def louvain_communities(edge_list):
    # Convert edge list to adjacency list
    adj_list = defaultdict(set)
    for u, v in edge_list:
        adj_list[u].add(v)
        adj_list[v].add(u)
    
    # Initialize each node as its own community
    communities = {node: i for i, node in enumerate(adj_list)}
    
    # Iteratively optimize modularity
    def modularity():
        m = len(edge_list)
        degrees = {node: len(neighbors) for node, neighbors in adj_list.items()}
        Q = 0.0
        for u, v in edge_list:
            if communities[u] == communities[v]:
                Q += 1 - (degrees[u] * degrees[v]) / (2 * m)
        return Q / (2 * m)
    
    def move_node(node):
        best_community = communities[node]
        best_gain = 0.0
        original_community = communities[node]
        
        for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
            if communities[neighbor] != original_community:
                gain = 0.0
                # Calculate gain in modularity if node moves to neighbor's community
                # This is a simplified version, actual Louvain algorithm is more complex
                gain = (1 / (2 * len(edge_list))) * (len(adj_list[node] & adj_list[neighbor]) - (degrees[node] * degrees[neighbor]) / (2 * len(edge_list)))
                
                if gain > best_gain:
                    best_gain = gain
                    best_community = communities[neighbor]
        
        if best_gain > 0:
            communities[node] = best_community
            return True
        return False
    
    improvement = True
    while improvement:
        improvement = False
        nodes = list(adj_list.keys())
        random.shuffle(nodes)
        for node in nodes:
            if move_node(node):
                improvement = True
    
    return communities

# Generate layout based on communities
def generate_layout(edge_list):
    communities = louvain_communities(edge_list)
    
    # Group nodes by community
    community_nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for node, community in communities.items():
        community_nodes[community].append(node)
    
    # Assign positions to communities in a circular layout
    num_communities = len(community_nodes)
    community_positions = {}
    radius = 100.0  # Radius of the circle for community centers
    angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_communities
    
    for i, (community, nodes) in enumerate(community_nodes.items()):
        angle = i * angle_step
        x = radius * math.cos(angle)
        y = radius * math.sin(angle)
        community_positions[community] = (x, y)
    
    # Assign positions to nodes within each community
    node_positions = {}
    for community, nodes in community_nodes.items():
        center_x, center_y = community_positions[community]
        num_nodes = len(nodes)
        node_radius = 20.0  # Radius for nodes within a community
        node_angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_nodes
        
        for j, node in enumerate(nodes):
            angle = j * node_angle_step
            x = center_x + node_radius * math.cos(angle)
            y = center_y + node_radius * math.sin(angle)
            node_positions[node] = (x, y)
    
    return node_positions

# Example usage
edge_list = [(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 22), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (8, 10), (8, 11), (8, 12), (8, 13), (8, 14), (8, 15), (9, 11), (9, 12), (9, 13), (9, 14), (9, 15), (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 13), (10, 14), (10, 15), (11, 12), (11, 13), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 15), (13, 14), (13, 15), (14, 18), (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 20), (16, 21), (16, 22), (17, 19), (17, 20), (17, 21), (17, 22), (18, 19), (18, 20), (18, 21), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 21), (19, 22), (20, 21)]

layout = generate_layout(edge_list)

# Convert layout to JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(layout, indent=4)

### Explanation:
1. **Community Detection**: The `louvain_communities` function detects communities using a simplified version of the Louvain algorithm. It assigns each node to a community based on modularity optimization.
2. **Layout Generation**: The `generate_layout` function assigns positions to nodes based on their community membership. Communities are placed in a circular layout, and nodes within each community are also placed in a circular fashion around the community center.
3. **Output**: The final layout is output in JSON format, where each node is mapped to its (x, y) position.

This code does not use any existing graph layout algorithms or visualization libraries, and it outputs the layout in JSON format as required.
