To generate a layout for the graph that minimizes edge crossings, we can use a force-directed layout algorithm. This algorithm simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to position the nodes in a way that minimizes edge crossings and makes the graph visually appealing.

Below is a Python script that implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm and outputs the graph layout in JSON format:

```python
import json
import random
import math

# Graph data
edges = [(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 16), 
          (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 8), (3, 5), (3, 10), (4, 5), (6, 9), (6, 10), (7, 8), 
          (7, 10), (8, 10), (9, 10), (11, 12), (11, 14), (12, 14), (12, 15), (12, 20), 
          (13, 14), (13, 15), (14, 20), (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 19), (16, 20), 
          (17, 18), (18, 19), (18, 20), (19, 20)]

# Extract unique nodes
nodes = list(set([node for edge in edges for node in edge]))

# Initialize positions randomly
positions = {node: (random.uniform(0, 1), random.uniform(0, 1)) for node in nodes}

# Parameters
k = 1.0  # Optimal distance between nodes
iterations = 100
temperature = 1.0
cooling_factor = 0.95

# Force-directed layout algorithm
for iteration in range(iterations):
    for node in nodes:
        force_x, force_y = 0.0, 0.0
        
        # Repulsive forces (between all pairs of nodes)
        for other_node in nodes:
            if node != other_node:
                dx = positions[other_node][0] - positions[node][0]
                dy = positions[other_node][1] - positions[node][1]
                distance = math.hypot(dx, dy)
                if distance > 0:
                    repulsive_force = k**2 / distance
                    force_x -= repulsive_force * dx / distance
                    force_y -= repulsive_force * dy / distance
        
        # Attractive forces (between connected nodes)
        for edge in edges:
            if node in edge:
                other_node = edge[0] if edge[1] == node else edge[1]
                dx = positions[other_node][0] - positions[node][0]
                dy = positions[other_node][1] - positions[node][1]
                distance = math.hypot(dx, dy)
                if distance > 0:
                    attractive_force = distance**2 / k
                    force_x += attractive_force * dx / distance
                    force_y += attractive_force * dy / distance
        
        # Update position
        positions[node] = (
            positions[node][0] + force_x * temperature,
            positions[node][1] + force_y * temperature
        )
    
    # Cool down the temperature
    temperature *= cooling_factor

# Normalize positions to fit within [0, 1] range
min_x = min(pos[0] for pos in positions.values())
min_y = min(pos[1] for pos in positions.values())
max_x = max(pos[0] for pos in positions.values())
max_y = max(pos[1] for pos in positions.values())

for node in positions:
    positions[node] = (
        (positions[node][0] - min_x) / (max_x - min_x),
        (positions[node][1] - min_y) / (max_y - min_y)
    )

# Output the layout in JSON format
layout = {str(node): {"x": pos[0], "y": pos[1]} for node, pos in positions.items()}
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The nodes are initialized with random positions within the range [0, 1].
2. **Force Calculation**: 
   - **Repulsive Forces**: These forces push nodes apart to prevent them from overlapping.
   - **Attractive Forces**: These forces pull connected nodes closer together.
3. **Position Update**: The positions of the nodes are updated based on the calculated forces.
4. **Cooling**: The temperature is reduced over time to allow the system to settle into a stable configuration.
5. **Normalization**: The positions are normalized to fit within the [0, 1] range.
6. **Output**: The final layout is output in JSON format.

This script provides a basic force-directed layout algorithm that can be further refined or extended depending on specific requirements.
