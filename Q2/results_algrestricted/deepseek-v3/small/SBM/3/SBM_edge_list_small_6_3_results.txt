To generate a layout for the graph that minimizes edge crossings, we can use a force-directed layout algorithm. This algorithm simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to position the nodes in a way that minimizes edge crossings and makes the graph visually appealing.

Below is a Python script that implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm and outputs the graph layout in JSON format:

```python
import json
import random
import math

# Define the graph as an edge list
edges = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), 
         (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 24), (5, 6), 
         (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 12), (8, 12), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), 
         (10, 12), (11, 12), (12, 24), (13, 16), (13, 17), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), 
         (14, 18), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 23), (19, 21), (19, 22), (19, 23), 
         (20, 21), (20, 22), (20, 24), (21, 22), (21, 23), (21, 24), (22, 23), (22, 24), 
         (23, 24)]

# Extract unique nodes from the edge list
nodes = list(set([node for edge in edges for node in edge]))

# Initialize node positions randomly
positions = {node: (random.uniform(0, 100), random.uniform(0, 100)) for node in nodes}

# Parameters for the force-directed layout
k = 1.0  # Optimal distance between nodes
iterations = 100
temperature = 100.0
cooling_factor = 0.95

# Force-directed layout algorithm
for iteration in range(iterations):
    # Calculate repulsive forces
    for node1 in nodes:
        for node2 in nodes:
            if node1 != node2:
                x1, y1 = positions[node1]
                x2, y2 = positions[node2]
                dx = x2 - x1
                dy = y2 - y1
                distance = math.hypot(dx, dy)
                if distance > 0:
                    force = k**2 / distance
                    positions[node1] = (x1 - force * dx / distance, y1 - force * dy / distance)
                    positions[node2] = (x2 + force * dx / distance, y2 + force * dy / distance)

    # Calculate attractive forces
    for edge in edges:
        node1, node2 = edge
        x1, y1 = positions[node1]
        x2, y2 = positions[node2]
        dx = x2 - x1
        dy = y2 - y1
        distance = math.hypot(dx, dy)
        if distance > 0:
            force = distance**2 / k
            positions[node1] = (x1 + force * dx / distance, y1 + force * dy / distance)
            positions[node2] = (x2 - force * dx / distance, y2 - force * dy / distance)

    # Cool down the temperature
    temperature *= cooling_factor

# Normalize positions to fit within a 0-100 range
min_x = min(pos[0] for pos in positions.values())
max_x = max(pos[0] for pos in positions.values())
min_y = min(pos[1] for pos in positions.values())
max_y = max(pos[1] for pos in positions.values())

for node in positions:
    x, y = positions[node]
    x = (x - min_x) / (max_x - min_x) * 100
    y = (y - min_y) / (max_y - min_y) * 100
    positions[node] = (x, y)

# Output the layout in JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The nodes are initialized with random positions within a 100x100 grid.
2. **Force-Directed Algorithm**:
   - **Repulsive Forces**: Nodes repel each other to avoid overlap.
   - **Attractive Forces**: Connected nodes attract each other to minimize edge lengths.
3. **Cooling**: The temperature decreases over iterations to reduce the magnitude of movements, allowing the layout to stabilize.
4. **Normalization**: The positions are normalized to fit within a 0-100 range.
5. **Output**: The final positions are output in JSON format.

This script provides a basic force-directed layout that minimizes edge crossings and can be further refined or optimized depending on specific requirements.
