To generate a layout for the graph that minimizes edge crossings, we can use a heuristic approach. One such approach is to use a force-directed layout algorithm, which simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to find a visually pleasing arrangement. However, since we cannot use existing graph layout algorithms, we will implement a simplified version of this approach.

Here is a Python script that generates a layout for the graph using a basic force-directed approach:

```python
import json
import random
import math

# Define the graph as an edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9),
    (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8), (5, 7), (6, 7),
    (7, 8), (9, 10), (9, 14), (9, 16), (9, 17), (9, 22), (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 15), (10, 16), (10, 17),
    (11, 12), (11, 13), (11, 14), (11, 16), (11, 17), (11, 24), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17),
    (13, 14), (13, 15), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (15, 17), (16, 17), (18, 19), (18, 20), (18, 21), (18, 22),
    (18, 23), (18, 24), (18, 25), (19, 20), (19, 21), (19, 22), (19, 23), (19, 24), (20, 22), (20, 23), (20, 24),
    (20, 25), (21, 22), (21, 23), (21, 25), (22, 23), (22, 24), (22, 25), (23, 24), (24, 25)
]

# Extract unique nodes from the edge list
nodes = list(set([node for edge in edge_list for node in edge]))

# Initialize node positions randomly
positions = {node: (random.uniform(0, 100), random.uniform(0, 100)) for node in nodes}

# Parameters for the force-directed layout
k = 1.0  # Spring constant
repulsion_constant = 100.0  # Repulsion constant
iterations = 100
cooling_factor = 0.95

# Function to calculate the distance between two points
def distance(p1, p2):
    return math.sqrt((p1[0] - p2[0])**2 + (p1[1] - p2[1])**2)

# Function to calculate the force between two nodes
def calculate_force(node1, node2, positions, k, repulsion_constant):
    pos1 = positions[node1]
    pos2 = positions[node2]
    dx = pos2[0] - pos1[0]
    dy = pos2[1] - pos1[1]
    dist = distance(pos1, pos2)
    if dist == 0:
        return (0, 0)
    force = k * (dist - 1)  # Attractive force for connected nodes
    if (node1, node2) not in edge_list and (node2, node1) not in edge_list:
        force = -repulsion_constant / dist**2  # Repulsive force for non-connected nodes
    fx = force * dx / dist
    fy = force * dy / dist
    return (fx, fy)

# Perform the force-directed layout algorithm
for iteration in range(iterations):
    new_positions = {}
    for node in nodes:
        total_fx, total_fy = 0, 0
        for other_node in nodes:
            if node != other_node:
                fx, fy = calculate_force(node, other_node, positions, k, repulsion_constant)
                total_fx += fx
                total_fy += fy
        new_positions[node] = (positions[node][0] + total_fx, positions[node][1] + total_fy)
    positions = new_positions
    k *= cooling_factor  # Cool down the system

# Convert positions to a JSON-compatible format
layout = {str(node): {"x": pos[0], "y": pos[1]} for node, pos in positions.items()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The nodes are initialized with random positions within a 100x100 grid.
2. **Force Calculation**: The forces between nodes are calculated based on their positions. Connected nodes attract each other, while non-connected nodes repel each other.
3. **Iteration**: The positions of the nodes are updated iteratively based on the calculated forces. The system "cools down" over time by reducing the spring constant `k`.
4. **Output**: The final positions of the nodes are output in JSON format.

This script provides a basic force-directed layout that aims to minimize edge crossings by simulating physical forces between nodes. The output is a JSON object where each node is mapped to its `(x, y)` coordinates.
