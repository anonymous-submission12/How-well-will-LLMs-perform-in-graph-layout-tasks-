To generate a layout for the graph that minimizes edge crossings, we can use a force-directed layout algorithm. This algorithm simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to position the nodes in a way that minimizes edge crossings and makes the graph visually appealing.

Below is a Python script that implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm. The script will output the graph layout in JSON format.

```python
import json
import random
import math

# Define the graph as an edge list
edges = [(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 12), (0, 17), (0, 19), 
         (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (4, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 10), 
         (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 17), (8, 9), (8, 10), 
         (9, 11), (10, 11), (12, 13), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17), 
         (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), 
         (15, 16), (15, 17), (16, 17), (18, 20), (18, 22), (19, 20), 
         (19, 21), (20, 21), (21, 22)]

# Extract unique nodes from the edge list
nodes = list(set([node for edge in edges for node in edge]))

# Initialize node positions randomly
positions = {node: (random.uniform(0, 1), random.uniform(0, 1)) for node in nodes}

# Parameters for the force-directed layout
k = 0.1  # Spring constant
repulsion_constant = 1000  # Repulsion constant
iterations = 1000

# Function to calculate the distance between two points
def distance(p1, p2):
    return math.sqrt((p1[0] - p2[0])**2 + (p1[1] - p2[1])**2)

# Force-directed layout algorithm
for _ in range(iterations):
    for node in nodes:
        force_x, force_y = 0, 0
        
        # Calculate repulsion forces from all other nodes
        for other_node in nodes:
            if node != other_node:
                dx = positions[node][0] - positions[other_node][0]
                dy = positions[node][1] - positions[other_node][1]
                dist = distance(positions[node], positions[other_node])
                if dist > 0:
                    force_x += repulsion_constant * dx / dist**3
                    force_y += repulsion_constant * dy / dist**3
        
        # Calculate attraction forces from connected nodes
        for edge in edges:
            if node in edge:
                other_node = edge[0] if edge[1] == node else edge[1]
                dx = positions[node][0] - positions[other_node][0]
                dy = positions[node][1] - positions[other_node][1]
                dist = distance(positions[node], positions[other_node])
                if dist > 0:
                    force_x -= k * dx / dist
                    force_y -= k * dy / dist
        
        # Update node position based on forces
        positions[node] = (positions[node][0] + force_x, positions[node][1] + force_y)

# Normalize positions to fit within a [0, 1] x [0, 1] square
min_x = min(pos[0] for pos in positions.values())
max_x = max(pos[0] for pos in positions.values())
min_y = min(pos[1] for pos in positions.values())
max_y = max(pos[1] for pos in positions.values())

for node in positions:
    positions[node] = (
        (positions[node][0] - min_x) / (max_x - min_x),
        (positions[node][1] - min_y) / (max_y - min_y)
    )

# Output the layout in JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The nodes are initialized with random positions within a unit square.
2. **Force Calculation**: For each node, the script calculates the repulsion force from all other nodes and the attraction force from connected nodes.
3. **Position Update**: The node's position is updated based on the calculated forces.
4. **Normalization**: After the iterations, the positions are normalized to fit within a [0, 1] x [0, 1] square.
5. **Output**: The final positions are output in JSON format.

This script provides a basic force-directed layout that should minimize edge crossings and produce a visually appealing graph layout.
