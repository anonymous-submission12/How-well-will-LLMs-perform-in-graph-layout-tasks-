To generate a layout for the graph that minimizes edge crossings, we can use a force-directed layout algorithm. This algorithm simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to position the nodes in a way that minimizes edge crossings and makes the graph visually appealing.

Below is a Python script that implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm. The final output is the graph layout in JSON format.

```python
import json
import random
import math

# Edge list of the graph
edges = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 11), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 10), (3, 17), (4, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 11), (8, 9), (8, 10), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 14), (11, 15), (12, 13), (12, 15), (12, 16), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 16), (14, 15), (14, 16), (15, 16), (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 20), (17, 21), (18, 19), (18, 20), (20, 21)]

# Get unique nodes
nodes = list(set([node for edge in edges for node in edge]))

# Initialize positions randomly
positions = {node: (random.uniform(0, 100), random.uniform(0, 100)) for node in nodes}

# Parameters for the force-directed layout
k = 1.0  # Optimal distance between nodes
iterations = 100
temperature = 100.0
cooling_factor = 0.95

# Force-directed layout algorithm
for iteration in range(iterations):
    # Calculate repulsive forces
    for node1 in nodes:
        for node2 in nodes:
            if node1 != node2:
                x1, y1 = positions[node1]
                x2, y2 = positions[node2]
                dx = x2 - x1
                dy = y2 - y1
                distance = math.hypot(dx, dy)
                if distance > 0:
                    force = k**2 / distance
                    positions[node1] = (x1 - force * dx / distance, y1 - force * dy / distance)
                    positions[node2] = (x2 + force * dx / distance, y2 + force * dy / distance)

    # Calculate attractive forces
    for edge in edges:
        node1, node2 = edge
        x1, y1 = positions[node1]
        x2, y2 = positions[node2]
        dx = x2 - x1
        dy = y2 - y1
        distance = math.hypot(dx, dy)
        if distance > 0:
            force = distance**2 / k
            positions[node1] = (x1 + force * dx / distance, y1 + force * dy / distance)
            positions[node2] = (x2 - force * dx / distance, y2 - force * dy / distance)

    # Cool down the temperature
    temperature *= cooling_factor

# Normalize positions to fit within a 0-100 range
min_x = min(pos[0] for pos in positions.values())
max_x = max(pos[0] for pos in positions.values())
min_y = min(pos[1] for pos in positions.values())
max_y = max(pos[1] for pos in positions.values())

for node in positions:
    x, y = positions[node]
    x = (x - min_x) / (max_x - min_x) * 100
    y = (y - min_y) / (max_y - min_y) * 100
    positions[node] = (x, y)

# Convert positions to JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The nodes are initialized with random positions within a 100x100 grid.
2. **Force Calculation**: 
   - **Repulsive Force**: Nodes repel each other to avoid overlap.
   - **Attractive Force**: Connected nodes attract each other to keep edges short.
3. **Cooling**: The temperature is reduced over iterations to stabilize the layout.
4. **Normalization**: The positions are normalized to fit within a 0-100 range.
5. **Output**: The final positions are output in JSON format.

This script provides a basic force-directed layout that minimizes edge crossings. You can adjust parameters like `k`, `iterations`, and `cooling_factor` to fine-tune the layout.
