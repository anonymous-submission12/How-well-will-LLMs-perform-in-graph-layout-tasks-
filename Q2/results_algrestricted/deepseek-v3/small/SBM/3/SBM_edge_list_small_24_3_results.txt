To generate a layout for the graph that minimizes edge crossings, we can use a force-directed layout algorithm. This algorithm simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to find a layout that minimizes edge crossings and makes the graph visually appealing.

Below is a Python script that implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm. The script will output the graph layout in JSON format.

```python
import json
import random
import math

# Define the graph as an edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 22), (5, 14),
    (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 10), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), (10, 26),
    (12, 13), (12, 16), (12, 17), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (13, 25), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 19), (15, 16), (15, 17), (16, 17),
    (18, 19), (18, 20), (18, 21), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 21), (20, 21), (20, 22), (21, 22),
    (23, 24), (23, 25), (23, 26), (23, 27), (24, 26), (24, 27), (25, 26), (25, 27), (26, 27)

                if distance > 0:
                    repulsive_force = k**2 / distance
                    force_x -= repulsive_force * dx / distance

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The script starts by defining the graph as an edge list and extracting the unique nodes. It then initializes random positions for each node.

2. **Force-Directed Layout**: The script iteratively calculates forces between nodes:
   - **Repulsive Forces**: Nodes repel each other to avoid overlap.
   - **Attractive Forces**: Connected nodes attract each other to minimize edge lengths.
   
   The forces are used to update the positions of the nodes.

3. **Cooling**: The temperature decreases over iterations, reducing the magnitude of the forces and allowing the layout to stabilize.

4. **Normalization**: The positions are normalized to fit within a 0-100 range.

5. **Output**: The final layout is output in JSON format.

This script provides a basic force-directed layout that minimizes edge crossings and can be further refined or extended depending on specific requirements.
