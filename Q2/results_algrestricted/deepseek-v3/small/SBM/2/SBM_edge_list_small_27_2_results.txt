To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a force-directed layout approach. This approach simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to position the nodes in a way that minimizes edge crossings and keeps connected nodes close together.

Below is a Python script that implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm. The script will output the graph layout in JSON format.

```python
import json
import math
import random

# Define the graph as an edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 16), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9), 
             (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 11), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 27), (5, 16), (6, 7), (6, 8), 
             (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), 
             (9, 10), (9, 11), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 16), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 17), 
             (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (15, 16), (15, 17), (16, 17), (16, 19), (18, 19), 
             (18, 21), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 22), (20, 21), (20, 22), (23, 27), (24, 26), 
             (24, 27), (25, 26), (25, 27), (26, 27)]

# Initialize node positions randomly
nodes = set()
for edge in edge_list:
    nodes.add(edge[0])
    nodes.add(edge[1])
nodes = list(nodes)
positions = {node: (random.uniform(0, 100), random.uniform(0, 100)) for node in nodes}

# Parameters for the force-directed layout
k = 1.0  # Optimal distance between nodes
iterations = 100
temperature = 100.0
cooling_factor = 0.95

# Force-directed layout algorithm
for iteration in range(iterations):
    for node in nodes:
        force_x, force_y = 0.0, 0.0
        
        # Calculate repulsive forces (between all nodes)
        for other_node in nodes:
            if node != other_node:
                dx = positions[other_node][0] - positions[node][0]
                dy = positions[other_node][1] - positions[node][1]
                distance = math.hypot(dx, dy)
                if distance > 0:
                    repulsive_force = k**2 / distance
                    force_x -= repulsive_force * (dx / distance)
                    force_y -= repulsive_force * (dy / distance)
        
        # Calculate attractive forces (between connected nodes)
        for edge in edge_list:
            if node == edge[0]:
                other_node = edge[1]
            elif node == edge[1]:
                other_node = edge[0]
            else:
                continue
            dx = positions[other_node][0] - positions[node][0]
            dy = positions[other_node][1] - positions[node][1]
            distance = math.hypot(dx, dy)
            if distance > 0:
                attractive_force = distance**2 / k
                force_x += attractive_force * (dx / distance)
                force_y += attractive_force * (dy / distance)
        
        # Update node position
        positions[node] = (
            positions[node][0] + (force_x * temperature),
            positions[node][1] + (force_y * temperature)
        )
    
    # Cool down the temperature
    temperature *= cooling_factor

# Output the layout in JSON format
layout = {str(node): {"x": pos[0], "y": pos[1]} for node, pos in positions.items()}
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The nodes are initialized with random positions within a 100x100 grid.
2. **Force Calculation**: 
   - **Repulsive Forces**: All nodes repel each other to avoid overlap.
   - **Attractive Forces**: Connected nodes attract each other to keep them close.
3. **Position Update**: The positions of the nodes are updated based on the calculated forces.
4. **Cooling**: The temperature is reduced over iterations to allow the system to settle into a stable configuration.
5. **Output**: The final positions of the nodes are output in JSON format.

This script will generate a layout where the Euclidean distance between nodes approximates their graph-theoretic distance, resulting in a visually coherent graph layout.
