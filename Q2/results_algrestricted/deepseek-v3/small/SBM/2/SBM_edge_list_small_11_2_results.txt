To generate a graph layout that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a force-directed layout approach. This approach simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to position the nodes in a way that minimizes edge crossings and keeps connected nodes close together.

Below is a Python script that implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm. The script will output the graph layout in JSON format.

```python
import json
import random
import math

# Edge list of the graph
edge_list = [(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 15), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), (3, 11), (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 11), (5, 7), (5, 9), (5, 10), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 23), (8, 9), (8, 10), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), (12, 14), (12, 16), (12, 18), (12, 19), (12, 21), (12, 22), (12, 23), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (13, 18), (13, 19), (13, 20), (13, 23), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (14, 20), (14, 22), (14, 23), (15, 18), (15, 19), (15, 20), (15, 21), (15, 23), (16, 18), (16, 19), (16, 20), (16, 22), (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 20), (17, 21), (17, 22), (17, 23), (18, 19), (18, 20), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 21), (19, 22), (19, 23), (20, 21), (20, 22), (20, 23), (21, 23), (22, 23)]

# Number of nodes in the graph
num_nodes = max(max(edge_list)) + 1

# Initialize positions randomly
positions = {i: (random.uniform(0, 1), random.uniform(0, 1)) for i in range(num_nodes)}

# Parameters for the force-directed layout
k = 1.0  # Optimal distance between nodes
t = 0.1  # Temperature (controls the movement)
max_iterations = 100

def distance(p1, p2):
    return math.sqrt((p1[0] - p2[0])**2 + (p1[1] - p2[1])**2)

def force_directed_layout(edge_list, positions, k, t, max_iterations):
    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        new_positions = positions.copy()
        
        # Calculate repulsive forces (between all pairs of nodes)
        for i in positions:
            for j in positions:
                if i != j:
                    dx = positions[j][0] - positions[i][0]
                    dy = positions[j][1] - positions[i][1]
                    dist = distance(positions[i], positions[j])
                    if dist > 0:
                        repulsive_force = k**2 / dist
                        new_positions[i] = (new_positions[i][0] - dx * repulsive_force * t,
                                            new_positions[i][1] - dy * repulsive_force * t)
        
        # Calculate attractive forces (between connected nodes)
        for u, v in edge_list:
            dx = positions[v][0] - positions[u][0]
            dy = positions[v][1] - positions[u][1]
            dist = distance(positions[u], positions[v])
            if dist > 0:
                attractive_force = dist**2 / k
                new_positions[u] = (new_positions[u][0] + dx * attractive_force * t,
                                     new_positions[u][1] + dy * attractive_force * t)

    return positions

# Generate the layout
layout = force_directed_layout(edge_list, positions, k, t, max_iterations)

# Convert the layout to JSON format
layout_json = {str(node): {"x": pos[0], "y": pos[1]} for node, pos in layout.items()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout_json, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The positions of the nodes are initialized randomly.
2. **Force Calculation**:
   - **Repulsive Force**: This force acts between all pairs of nodes to prevent them from getting too close to each other.
   - **Attractive Force**: This force acts between connected nodes to pull them closer together.
3. **Iteration**: The forces are applied iteratively to adjust the positions of the nodes.
4. **Output**: The final positions of the nodes are output in JSON format.

### Output:
The script will output the graph layout in JSON format, where each node is associated with its `(x, y)` coordinates.

```json
{
    "0": {
        "x": 0.123,
        "y": 0.456
    },
    "1": {
        "x": 0.234,
        "y": 0.567
    },
    ...
}
```

This JSON can be used to visualize the graph using any plotting library or tool of your choice.
