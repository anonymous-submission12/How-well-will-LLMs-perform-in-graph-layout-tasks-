To generate a graph layout that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a force-directed layout approach. This approach simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to position the nodes in a way that minimizes edge crossings and keeps connected nodes close together.

Below is a Python script that implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm. The script will output the graph layout in JSON format.

```python
import json
import random
import math

# Define the graph as an edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 11), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 11), (6, 13), (7, 10), (7, 11), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), (12, 13), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17), (13, 15), (13, 17), (13, 25), (14, 15), (14, 17), (15, 16), (15, 17), (15, 22), (16, 17), (18, 19), (18, 21), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 21), (20, 22), (23, 24), (23, 25), (23, 26), (23, 27), (24, 25), (24, 26), (24, 27), (25, 26), (25, 27), (26, 27)]

# Initialize node positions randomly
nodes = set()
for edge in edge_list:
    nodes.add(edge[0])
    nodes.add(edge[1])

positions = {node: (random.uniform(0, 100), random.uniform(0, 100)) for node in nodes}

# Parameters for the force-directed layout
k = 1.0  # Spring constant
repulsion_constant = 100.0  # Repulsion constant
iterations = 100
cooling_factor = 0.95

# Force-directed layout algorithm
for iteration in range(iterations):
    # Calculate repulsive forces
    for node1 in nodes:
        for node2 in nodes:
            if node1 != node2:
                dx = positions[node2][0] - positions[node1][0]
                dy = positions[node2][1] - positions[node1][1]
                distance = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)
                if distance > 0:
                    force = repulsion_constant / distance**2
                    positions[node1] = (positions[node1][0] - force * dx / distance, positions[node1][1] - force * dy / distance)
                    positions[node2] = (positions[node2][0] + force * dx / distance, positions[node2][1] + force * dy / distance)

    # Calculate attractive forces (spring forces)
    for edge in edge_list:
        node1, node2 = edge
        dx = positions[node2][0] - positions[node1][0]
        dy = positions[node2][1] - positions[node1][1]
        distance = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)
        if distance > 0:
            force = k * distance
            positions[node1] = (positions[node1][0] + force * dx / distance, positions[node1][1] + force * dy / distance)
            positions[node2] = (positions[node2][0] - force * dx / distance, positions[node2][1] - force * dy / distance)

    # Cool down the system
    repulsion_constant *= cooling_factor

# Convert positions to JSON format
layout = {str(node): {"x": pos[0], "y": pos[1]} for node, pos in positions.items()}
layout_json = json.dumps(layout, indent=4)

print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The nodes are initialized with random positions within a 100x100 grid.
2. **Force Calculation**:
   - **Repulsive Forces**: Nodes repel each other to avoid overlap.
   - **Attractive Forces**: Connected nodes attract each other to keep edges short.
3. **Cooling**: The repulsion constant is reduced over iterations to allow the system to settle.
4. **Output**: The final positions of the nodes are output in JSON format.

This script provides a basic force-directed layout that can be further refined by adjusting parameters like `k`, `repulsion_constant`, and `cooling_factor`.
