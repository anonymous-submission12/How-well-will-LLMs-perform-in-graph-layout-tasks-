To generate a graph layout that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a force-directed layout approach. This approach simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to position the nodes in a way that minimizes edge crossings and keeps connected nodes close together.

Below is a Python script that implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm. The script will output the graph layout in JSON format.

```python
import json
import math
import random

# Define the edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 9), (0, 10), 
             (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (2, 3), (2, 4), 
             (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 10), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), 
             (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), (3, 18), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), 
             (4, 9), (5, 6), (5, 9), (5, 10), (6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 20), (7, 8), 
             (7, 9), (7, 10), (8, 9), (8, 10), (9, 20), (11, 12), (11, 13), 
             (11, 14), (11, 17), (11, 18), (11, 19), (11, 20), (12, 13), (12, 14),

             (16, 20), (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 20), (18, 19), (18, 20), (19, 20)]

# Initialize node positions randomly
nodes = set()
for edge in edge_list:
    nodes.add(edge[0])
    nodes.add(edge[1])
nodes = list(nodes)

# Initialize positions randomly
positions = {node: (random.uniform(0, 100), random.uniform(0, 100)) for node in nodes}

# Parameters for the force-directed layout

def distance(p1, p2):
    return math.sqrt((p1[0] - p2[0])**2 + (p1[1] - p2[1])**2)

                dy = positions[node2][1] - positions[node1][1]
                dist = distance(positions[node1], positions[node2])
                if dist > 0:
                    force = repulsion_constant / (dist ** 2)
                    positions[node1] = (positions[node1][0] - force * dx / dist * dt,
                                       positions[node1][1] - force * dy / dist * dt)

    # Calculate attractive forces (spring forces)
    for edge in edge_list:
        node1, node2 = edge
        dx = positions[node2][0] - positions[node1][0]
        dy = positions[node2][1] - positions[node1][1]
        dist = distance(positions[node1], positions[node2])
        if dist > 0:
            force = k * (dist - 1.0)  # Spring force (Hooke's law)
            positions[node1] = (positions[node1][0] + force * dx / dist * dt,
                                positions[node1][1] + force * dy / dist * dt)

# Normalize positions to fit within a unit square

min_y = min(pos[1] for pos in positions.values())
max_x = max(pos[0] for pos in positions.values())

for node in positions:
    x, y = positions[node]
    x = (x - min_x) / (max_x - min_x)
    y = (y - min_y) / (max_y - min_y)
    positions[node] = (x, y)

# Output the layout in JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)

```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The nodes are initialized with random positions within a 100x100 grid.
2. **Force-Directed Layout**:
   - **Repulsive Forces**: Nodes repel each other to avoid overlap.
   - **Attractive Forces**: Connected nodes attract each other to maintain graph-theoretic distance.
3. **Normalization**: The positions are normalized to fit within a unit square (0 to 1 in both x and y dimensions).
4. **Output**: The final positions are output in JSON format.

This script provides a basic force-directed layout that can be further refined by adjusting parameters like `k`, `repulsion_constant`, `iterations`, and `dt`.
