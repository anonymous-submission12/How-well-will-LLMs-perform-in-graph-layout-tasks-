To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a force-directed layout approach. This approach simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to position the nodes in a way that minimizes edge crossings and keeps connected nodes close together.

Below is a Python script that implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm. The script will output the graph layout in JSON format.

```python
import json
import random
import math

# Define the edge list
edge_list = [(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 22), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 28), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 8), (7, 9), (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 13), (10, 14), (10, 16), (10, 17), (10, 18), (10, 19), (11, 12), (11, 13), (11, 14), (11, 15), (11, 16), (11, 17), (11, 18), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17), (12, 19), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 18), (13, 19), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (15, 16), (15, 18), (15, 19), (16, 17), (16, 18), (17, 19), (17, 21), (18, 19), (20, 22), (20, 23), (20, 24), (20, 25), (20, 26), (20, 27), (20, 28), (21, 23), (21, 24), (21, 25), (21, 26), (21, 27), (21, 28), (22, 23), (22, 24), (22, 25), (22, 28), (23, 26), (23, 28), (24, 25), (24, 26), (24, 28), (25, 27), (25, 28), (26, 27), (27, 28)]

# Extract unique nodes
nodes = list(set([node for edge in edge_list for node in edge]))

# Initialize node positions randomly
positions = {node: (random.uniform(0, 100), random.uniform(0, 100)) for node in nodes}

# Parameters for the force-directed layout

iterations = 100

def distance(p1, p2):
    return math.sqrt((p1[0] - p2[0])**2 + (p1[1] - p2[1])**2)

# Force-directed layout algorithm

    # Calculate repulsive forces

        for node2 in nodes:

                dx = positions[node2][0] - positions[node1][0]
                dy = positions[node2][1] - positions[node1][1]
                dist = distance(positions[node1], positions[node2])
                if dist > 0:
                    force = repulsion_constant / dist**2
                    positions[node1] = (positions[node1][0] - force * dx / dist * dt,
                                        positions[node1][1] - force * dy / dist * dt)

    # Calculate attractive forces (spring forces)
    for edge in edge_list:
        node1, node2 = edge
        dx = positions[node2][0] - positions[node1][0]
        dy = positions[node2][1] - positions[node1][1]
        dist = distance(positions[node1], positions[node2])
        if dist > 0:
            force = k * dist
            positions[node1] = (positions[node1][0] + force * dx / dist * dt,
                                positions[node1][1] + force * dy / dist * dt)

for node in positions:

    x = (x - min_x) / (max_x - min_x)

# Output the layout in JSON format

```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The nodes are initialized with random positions within a 100x100 grid.
2. **Force Calculation**:
   - **Repulsive Forces**: Nodes repel each other to avoid overlap.
   - **Attractive Forces**: Connected nodes attract each other to maintain graph-theoretic distance.
3. **Iteration**: The forces are applied iteratively to adjust the positions of the nodes.
4. **Normalization**: The positions are normalized to fit within a unit square (0 to 1 in both x and y dimensions).
5. **Output**: The final positions are output in JSON format.

This script provides a basic force-directed layout that can be further refined by adjusting parameters like `k`, `repulsion_constant`, `iterations`, and `dt`.
