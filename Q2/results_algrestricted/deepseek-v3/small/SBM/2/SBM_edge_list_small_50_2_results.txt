To generate a graph layout that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a force-directed layout approach. This approach simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to position the nodes in a way that minimizes the energy of the system.

Below is a Python script that implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm. The script will output the graph layout in JSON format.

```python
import json
import random
import math

# Define the graph as an edge list
edge_list = [(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 16), 
             (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 8), (3, 5), (3, 10), (4, 5), (6, 9), (6, 10), (7, 8), 
             (7, 10), (8, 10), (9, 10), (11, 12), (11, 14), (12, 14), (12, 15), (12, 20), 
             (13, 14), (13, 15), (14, 20), (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 19), (16, 20), 
             (17, 18), (18, 19), (18, 20), (19, 20)]

# Extract unique nodes from the edge list
nodes = list(set([node for edge in edge_list for node in edge]))

# Initialize node positions randomly
positions = {node: (random.uniform(0, 1), random.uniform(0, 1)) for node in nodes}

# Parameters for the force-directed layout
k = 1.0  # Optimal distance between nodes
t = 0.1  # Temperature (controls the movement)
max_iterations = 100

# Function to calculate the Euclidean distance between two nodes
def distance(node1, node2):
    return math.sqrt((positions[node1][0] - positions[node2][0])**2 + 
                     (positions[node1][1] - positions[node2][1])**2)

# Force-directed layout algorithm
for iteration in range(max_iterations):
    for node in nodes:
        force_x, force_y = 0.0, 0.0
        
        # Calculate repulsive forces from all other nodes
        for other_node in nodes:
            if node != other_node:
                dx = positions[node][0] - positions[other_node][0]
                dy = positions[node][1] - positions[other_node][1]
                dist = distance(node, other_node)
                if dist > 0:
                    repulsive_force = k**2 / dist
                    force_x += repulsive_force * dx / dist
                    force_y += repulsive_force * dy / dist
        
        # Calculate attractive forces from connected nodes
        for edge in edge_list:
            if node in edge:
                other_node = edge[0] if edge[1] == node else edge[1]
                dx = positions[node][0] - positions[other_node][0]
                dy = positions[node][1] - positions[other_node][1]
                dist = distance(node, other_node)
                attractive_force = dist**2 / k
                force_x -= attractive_force * dx / dist
                force_y -= attractive_force * dy / dist
        
        # Update node position
        positions[node] = (positions[node][0] + t * force_x, 
                           positions[node][1] + t * force_y)

# Normalize positions to fit within a unit square
min_x = min(pos[0] for pos in positions.values())
max_x = max(pos[0] for pos in positions.values())
min_y = min(pos[1] for pos in positions.values())
max_y = max(pos[1] for pos in positions.values())

for node in positions:
    positions[node] = (
        (positions[node][0] - min_x) / (max_x - min_x),
        (positions[node][1] - min_y) / (max_y - min_y)
    )

# Convert positions to JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The nodes are initialized with random positions within a unit square.
2. **Force Calculation**: For each node, the script calculates the repulsive force from all other nodes and the attractive force from connected nodes.
3. **Position Update**: The node's position is updated based on the calculated forces.
4. **Normalization**: After the iterations, the positions are normalized to fit within a unit square.
5. **Output**: The final positions are output in JSON format.

This script provides a basic force-directed layout that attempts to maintain consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance. The layout can be further refined by adjusting parameters such as `k`, `t`, and `max_iterations`.
