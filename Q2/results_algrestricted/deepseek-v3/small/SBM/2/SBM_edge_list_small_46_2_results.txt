To generate a graph layout that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a force-directed layout approach. This approach simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to position the nodes in a way that minimizes the energy of the system.

Below is a Python script that implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm. The script will output the graph layout in JSON format.

```python
import json
import random
import math

# Define the graph as an edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 12), (0, 17), (0, 19), 
             (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (4, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 10), 
             (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 17), (8, 9), (8, 10), 
             (9, 11), (10, 11), (12, 13), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17), 
             (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), 
             (15, 16), (15, 17), (16, 17), (18, 20), (18, 22), (19, 20), 
             (19, 21), (20, 21), (21, 22)]

# Initialize node positions randomly
nodes = set()
for edge in edge_list:
    nodes.add(edge[0])
    nodes.add(edge[1])
nodes = list(nodes)

positions = {node: (random.uniform(0, 1), random.uniform(0, 1)) for node in nodes}

# Parameters for the force-directed layout
k = 1.0  # Spring constant
repulsion_constant = 100.0  # Repulsion constant
iterations = 100
cooling_factor = 0.95

# Function to calculate the Euclidean distance between two points
def distance(p1, p2):
    return math.sqrt((p1[0] - p2[0])**2 + (p1[1] - p2[1])**2)

# Force-directed layout algorithm
for iteration in range(iterations):
    # Calculate repulsive forces
    for node1 in nodes:
        for node2 in nodes:
            if node1 != node2:
                dx = positions[node1][0] - positions[node2][0]
                dy = positions[node1][1] - positions[node2][1]
                dist = distance(positions[node1], positions[node2])
                if dist > 0:
                    force = repulsion_constant / (dist**2)
                    positions[node1] = (positions[node1][0] + force * dx / dist, 
                                        positions[node1][1] + force * dy / dist)
    
    # Calculate attractive forces (spring forces)
    for edge in edge_list:
        node1, node2 = edge
        dx = positions[node1][0] - positions[node2][0]
        dy = positions[node1][1] - positions[node2][1]
        dist = distance(positions[node1], positions[node2])
        if dist > 0:
            force = k * (dist - 1)  # Assuming ideal distance is 1
            positions[node1] = (positions[node1][0] - force * dx / dist, 
                               positions[node1][1] - force * dy / dist)
            positions[node2] = (positions[node2][0] + force * dx / dist, 
                               positions[node2][1] + force * dy / dist)
    
    # Cooling down the system
    repulsion_constant *= cooling_factor

# Normalize positions to fit within a unit square
min_x = min(pos[0] for pos in positions.values())
max_x = max(pos[0] for pos in positions.values())
min_y = min(pos[1] for pos in positions.values())
max_y = max(pos[1] for pos in positions.values())

for node in positions:
    x, y = positions[node]
    x = (x - min_x) / (max_x - min_x)
    y = (y - min_y) / (max_y - min_y)
    positions[node] = (x, y)

# Output the layout in JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The nodes are initialized with random positions within a unit square.
2. **Force Calculation**:
   - **Repulsive Forces**: Nodes repel each other to avoid overlap.
   - **Attractive Forces**: Connected nodes attract each other to maintain graph-theoretic distances.
3. **Cooling**: The repulsion constant is reduced over iterations to allow the system to settle.
4. **Normalization**: The positions are normalized to fit within a unit square.

### Output:
The script outputs the graph layout in JSON format, where each node is mapped to its `(x, y)` coordinates.

You can run this script to generate the layout for the provided graph. The output will be a JSON object that you can use for further processing or visualization.
