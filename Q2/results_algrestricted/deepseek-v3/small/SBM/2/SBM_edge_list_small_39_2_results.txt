To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a force-directed layout approach. This approach simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to position the nodes in a way that minimizes edge crossings and keeps connected nodes close together.

Below is a Python script that implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm. The script will output the graph layout in JSON format.

```python
import json
import random
import math

# Define the graph as an edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 12),
    (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (1, 11),
    (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10),
    (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 10),

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The nodes are initialized with random positions within a unit square.
2. **Force Calculation**:
   - **Repulsive Forces**: All pairs of nodes repel each other, with the force inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
   - **Attractive Forces**: Connected nodes attract each other, with the force proportional to the distance between them.
3. **Position Update**: The positions of the nodes are updated based on the calculated forces.
4. **Normalization**: The positions are normalized to fit within a unit square.
5. **Output**: The final positions are output in JSON format.

This script provides a basic force-directed layout that should give you a reasonable starting point for visualizing the graph. You can adjust the parameters (`k`, `repulsion_constant`, `iterations`, `dt`) to fine-tune the layout.
