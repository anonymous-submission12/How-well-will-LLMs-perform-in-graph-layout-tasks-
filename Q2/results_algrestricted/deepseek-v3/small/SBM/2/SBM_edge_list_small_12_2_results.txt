To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a force-directed layout approach. This approach simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to position the nodes in a way that minimizes the energy of the system.

Below is a Python script that implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm. The script will output the graph layout in JSON format.

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The nodes are initialized with random positions within the unit square `[0, 1] x [0, 1]`.
2. **Force Calculation**: For each node, the forces acting on it are calculated. These forces include:
   - **Repulsive forces**: Nodes repel each other to avoid overlap.
   - **Attractive forces**: Connected nodes attract each other to maintain a reasonable distance.
3. **Position Update**: The positions of the nodes are updated based on the calculated forces.
4. **Normalization**: The positions are normalized to ensure they fit within the `[0, 1]` range.
5. **Output**: The final positions are output in JSON format.

This script provides a basic force-directed layout that should give you a reasonable starting point for visualizing the graph. You can adjust parameters like `k`, `t`, and `max_iterations` to fine-tune the layout.
