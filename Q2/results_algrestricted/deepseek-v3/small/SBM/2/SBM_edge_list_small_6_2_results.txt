To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a force-directed layout approach. This approach simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to position the nodes in a way that minimizes edge crossings and keeps connected nodes close together.

Below is a Python script that implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm. The final layout is output in JSON format.

```python
import json
import random
import math

# Define the graph as an edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), 
    (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 24), (5, 6), 
    (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 12), (8, 12), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), 
    (10, 12), (11, 12), (12, 24), (13, 16), (13, 17), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), 
    (14, 18), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 23), (19, 21), (19, 22), (19, 23), 
    (20, 21), (20, 22), (20, 24), (21, 22), (21, 23), (21, 24), (22, 23), (22, 24), 
    (23, 24)
]

# Extract unique nodes from the edge list
nodes = list(set([node for edge in edge_list for node in edge]))

# Initialize node positions randomly
positions = {node: (random.uniform(0, 100), random.uniform(0, 100)) for node in nodes}

cooling_factor = 0.95

# Force-directed layout algorithm
for iteration in range(iterations):
    # Calculate repulsive forces
    for node1 in nodes:
        for node2 in nodes:
            if node1 != node2:
                dx = positions[node2][0] - positions[node1][0]
                dy = positions[node2][1] - positions[node1][1]
                distance = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)
                if distance > 0:
                    force = k**2 / distance
                    positions[node1] = (
                        positions[node1][0] - force * dx / distance,
                        positions[node1][1] - force * dy / distance
                    )

    # Calculate attractive forces
    for edge in edge_list:

            force = distance**2 / k

                positions[node1][0] + force * dx / distance,
                positions[node1][1] + force * dy / distance
            )
            positions[node2] = (

                positions[node2][1] - force * dy / distance
            )

    # Cool down the temperature
    temperature *= cooling_factor

# Normalize positions to fit within a 0-100 range
min_x = min(pos[0] for pos in positions.values())
max_x = max(pos[0] for pos in positions.values())
min_y = min(pos[1] for pos in positions.values())
max_y = max(pos[1] for pos in positions.values())

for node in positions:
    positions[node] = (
        (positions[node][0] - min_x) / (max_x - min_x) * 100,
        (positions[node][1] - min_y) / (max_y - min_y) * 100

# Output the layout in JSON format

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The nodes are initialized with random positions within a 100x100 grid.
2. **Force-Directed Layout**: The algorithm iteratively calculates repulsive forces between all pairs of nodes and attractive forces between connected nodes. The forces are used to update the positions of the nodes.
3. **Cooling**: The temperature is reduced over time to allow the system to settle into a stable configuration.
4. **Normalization**: The positions are normalized to fit within a 0-100 range.
5. **Output**: The final positions are output in JSON format.

This script provides a basic force-directed layout that can be further refined or adjusted based on specific requirements.
