To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a force-directed layout approach. This approach simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to position the nodes in a way that minimizes edge crossings and keeps connected nodes close together.

Below is a Python script that implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm. The script will output the graph layout in JSON format.

```python
import json
import random
import math

# Define the edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 11), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10),
    (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10),
    (3, 11), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (5, 10), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9),
    (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (9, 11), (9, 22), (12, 13), (12, 14),
    (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17), (12, 18), (12, 19), (12, 20), (12, 21), (12, 22), (12, 23), (13, 14), (13, 15),

    (19, 23), (20, 21), (20, 22), (21, 22), (21, 23)

# Extract unique nodes
nodes = list(set([node for edge in edge_list for node in edge]))

# Initialize node positions randomly
positions = {node: (random.uniform(0, 100), random.uniform(0, 100)) for node in nodes}

# Parameters for the force-directed layout
k = 1.0  # Spring constant

iterations = 1000
cooling_factor = 0.95

# Force-directed layout algorithm
for iteration in range(iterations):
    # Calculate repulsive forces

        for node2 in nodes:
            if node1 != node2:
                x1, y1 = positions[node1]
                x2, y2 = positions[node2]

                dy = y2 - y1
                distance = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)
                if distance > 0:
                    force = repulsion_constant / distance**2
                    positions[node1] = (x1 - force * dx / distance, y1 - force * dy / distance)
                    positions[node2] = (x2 + force * dx / distance, y2 + force * dy / distance)

    # Calculate attractive forces (spring forces)
    for edge in edge_list:
        node1, node2 = edge
        x1, y1 = positions[node1]

            force = k * distance
            positions[node1] = (x1 + force * dx / distance, y1 + force * dy / distance)
            positions[node2] = (x2 - force * dx / distance, y2 - force * dy / distance)

    # Cooling down the system
    repulsion_constant *= cooling_factor

# Convert positions to JSON format

# Output the layout in JSON format

```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The nodes are initialized with random positions within a 100x100 grid.
2. **Force Calculation**:
   - **Repulsive Forces**: Nodes repel each other to avoid overlap.
   - **Attractive Forces**: Connected nodes attract each other to keep edges short.
3. **Cooling Factor**: The repulsion constant is reduced over iterations to allow the system to settle.
4. **Output**: The final positions of the nodes are output in JSON format.

This script provides a basic force-directed layout that can be further refined by adjusting parameters like `k`, `repulsion_constant`, and `cooling_factor`.
