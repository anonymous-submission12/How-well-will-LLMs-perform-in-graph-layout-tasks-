To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a force-directed layout approach. This approach simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to position the nodes in a way that minimizes edge crossings and keeps connected nodes close together.

Below is a Python script that implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm. The script will output the graph layout in JSON format.

```python
import json
import random
import math

# Define the graph as an edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 22), (5, 14), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 10), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (9, 10), (9, 11), (10, 11), (10, 26), (12, 13), (12, 16), (12, 17), (13, 15), (13, 16), (13, 17), (13, 25), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 19), (15, 16), (15, 17), (16, 17), (18, 19), (18, 20), (18, 21), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 21), (20, 21), (20, 22), (21, 22), (23, 24), (23, 25), (23, 26), (23, 27), (24, 26), (24, 27), (25, 26), (25, 27), (26, 27)]

# Initialize node positions randomly
nodes = set()
for edge in edge_list:
    nodes.add(edge[0])
    nodes.add(edge[1])
nodes = list(nodes)
positions = {node: (random.uniform(0, 1), random.uniform(0, 1)) for node in nodes}

# Parameters for the force-directed layout
k = 1.0  # Optimal distance between nodes
iterations = 100
temperature = 1.0
cooling_factor = 0.95

# Force-directed layout algorithm
for iteration in range(iterations):
    for node in nodes:
        force_x, force_y = 0.0, 0.0
        
        # Repulsive forces (between all pairs of nodes)
        for other_node in nodes:
            if node != other_node:
                dx = positions[other_node][0] - positions[node][0]
                dy = positions[other_node][1] - positions[node][1]
                distance = math.hypot(dx, dy)
                if distance > 0:
                    repulsive_force = k**2 / distance
                    force_x -= repulsive_force * (dx / distance)
                    force_y -= repulsive_force * (dy / distance)
        
        # Attractive forces (between connected nodes)
        for edge in edge_list:
            if node == edge[0]:
                other_node = edge[1]
            elif node == edge[1]:
                other_node = edge[0]
            else:
                continue
            dx = positions[other_node][0] - positions[node][0]
            dy = positions[other_node][1] - positions[node][1]
            distance = math.hypot(dx, dy)
            if distance > 0:
                attractive_force = distance**2 / k
                force_x += attractive_force * (dx / distance)
                force_y += attractive_force * (dy / distance)
        
        # Update node position
        positions[node] = (
            positions[node][0] + force_x * temperature,
            positions[node][1] + force_y * temperature
        )
    
    # Cool down the temperature
    temperature *= cooling_factor

# Output the layout in JSON format
layout = {str(node): {"x": pos[0], "y": pos[1]} for node, pos in positions.items()}
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The nodes are initialized with random positions within a unit square.
2. **Force Calculation**: 
   - **Repulsive Forces**: These forces act between all pairs of nodes to prevent them from getting too close to each other.
   - **Attractive Forces**: These forces act between connected nodes to pull them closer together.
3. **Position Update**: The positions of the nodes are updated based on the calculated forces.
4. **Cooling**: The temperature is reduced over time to allow the system to settle into a stable configuration.
5. **Output**: The final positions of the nodes are output in JSON format.

This script provides a basic force-directed layout that should give you a reasonable starting point for visualizing the graph. You can adjust parameters like `k`, `iterations`, and `cooling_factor` to fine-tune the layout.
