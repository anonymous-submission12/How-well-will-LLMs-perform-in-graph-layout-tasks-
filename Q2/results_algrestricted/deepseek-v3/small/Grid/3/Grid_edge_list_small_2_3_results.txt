To generate a layout for the graph that minimizes edge crossings, we can use a simple grid-based approach. The idea is to place nodes in a grid-like structure, which often helps in reducing edge crossings, especially for structured graphs like the one provided.

Here is a Python script that generates a layout for the graph and outputs it in JSON format:

```python
import json

# Input edge list
edges = [(0, 1), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 8), (4, 9), 
          (5, 6), (5, 10), (6, 7), (6, 11), (7, 8), (7, 12), (8, 9), (8, 13), 
          (9, 14), (10, 11), (10, 15), (11, 12), (11, 16), (12, 13), (12, 17), 
          (13, 14), (13, 18), (14, 19), (15, 16), (15, 20), (16, 17), (16, 21), 
          (17, 18), (17, 22), (18, 19), (18, 23), (19, 24), (20, 21), (21, 22), 
          (22, 23), (23, 24)]

# Determine the number of nodes
nodes = set()
for edge in edges:
    nodes.add(edge[0])
    nodes.add(edge[1])
num_nodes = len(nodes)

# Create a grid layout
# Assuming a 5x5 grid for 25 nodes
grid_size = 5
layout = {}
for i in range(num_nodes):
    row = i // grid_size
    col = i % grid_size
    layout[i] = {"x": col, "y": row}

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Edge List**: The edge list is provided as input.
2. **Determine Nodes**: We extract all unique nodes from the edge list.
3. **Grid Layout**: We assume a 5x5 grid for 25 nodes. Each node is assigned a position in the grid based on its index.
4. **Output**: The layout is output in JSON format, where each node is mapped to its `(x, y)` position on the grid.

### Output Example:
```json
{
    "0": {
        "x": 0,
        "y": 0
    },
    "1": {
        "x": 1,
        "y": 0
    },
    "2": {
        "x": 2,
        "y": 0
    },
    "3": {
        "x": 3,
        "y": 0
    },
    "4": {
        "x": 4,
        "y": 0
    },
    "5": {
        "x": 0,
        "y": 1
    },
    "6": {
        "x": 1,
        "y": 1
    },
    "7": {
        "x": 2,
        "y": 1
    },
    "8": {
        "x": 3,
        "y": 1
    },
    "9": {
        "x": 4,
        "y": 1
    },
    "10": {
        "x": 0,
        "y": 2
    },
    "11": {
        "x": 1,
        "y": 2
    },
    "12": {
        "x": 2,
        "y": 2
    },
    "13": {
        "x": 3,
        "y": 2
    },
    "14": {
        "x": 4,
        "y": 2
    },
    "15": {
        "x": 0,
        "y": 3
    },
    "16": {
        "x": 1,
        "y": 3
    },
    "17": {
        "x": 2,
        "y": 3
    },
    "18": {
        "x": 3,
        "y": 3
    },
    "19": {
        "x": 4,
        "y": 3
    },
    "20": {
        "x": 0,
        "y": 4
    },
    "21": {
        "x": 1,
        "y": 4
    },
    "22": {
        "x": 2,
        "y": 4
    },
    "23": {
        "x": 3,
        "y": 4
    },
    "24": {
        "x": 4,
        "y": 4
    }
}
```

This layout places nodes in a grid, which should help in minimizing edge crossings for this particular graph structure.
