To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a simple approach where we place nodes in a grid-like structure. This approach ensures that nodes connected by edges are close to each other, and nodes that are farther apart in the graph-theoretic sense are also farther apart in Euclidean space.

Here is a Python script that generates such a layout and outputs it in JSON format:

```python
import json
from collections import defaultdict

# Input edge list
edges = [(0, 1), (0, 14), (1, 2), (1, 15), (2, 3), (2, 16), (3, 4), (3, 17), 
         (4, 5), (4, 18), (5, 6), (5, 19), (6, 7), (6, 20), (7, 8), (7, 21), 
         (8, 9), (8, 22), (9, 10), (9, 23), (10, 11), (10, 24), (11, 12), 
         (11, 25), (12, 13), (12, 26), (13, 27), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), 
         (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), 
         (24, 25), (25, 26), (26, 27)]

# Create an adjacency list
adj_list = defaultdict(list)
for u, v in edges:
    adj_list[u].append(v)
    adj_list[v].append(u)

# Determine the number of nodes
nodes = set()
for u, v in edges:
    nodes.add(u)
    nodes.add(v)
num_nodes = len(nodes)

# Assign positions in a grid-like structure
positions = {}
grid_size = int(num_nodes ** 0.5) + 1

for i, node in enumerate(sorted(nodes)):
    row = i // grid_size
    col = i % grid_size
    positions[node] = [col, row]

# Output the layout in JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Adjacency List**: We first create an adjacency list to represent the graph.
2. **Grid Layout**: We then assign positions to each node in a grid-like structure. The grid size is determined by the square root of the number of nodes, ensuring that the nodes are spread out evenly.
3. **JSON Output**: Finally, we output the positions in JSON format.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node, and the value is a list of two numbers representing the `(x, y)` coordinates of the node in the layout.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 0],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [3, 0],
    "4": [4, 0],
    "5": [5, 0],
    "6": [6, 0],
    "7": [7, 0],
    "8": [8, 0],
    "9": [9, 0],
    "10": [10, 0],
    "11": [11, 0],
    "12": [12, 0],
    "13": [13, 0],
    "14": [0, 1],
    "15": [1, 1],
    "16": [2, 1],
    "17": [3, 1],
    "18": [4, 1],
    "19": [5, 1],
    "20": [6, 1],
    "21": [7, 1],
    "22": [8, 1],
    "23": [9, 1],
    "24": [10, 1],
    "25": [11, 1],
    "26": [12, 1],
    "27": [13, 1]
}
```

This layout ensures that nodes connected by edges are close to each other, and nodes that are farther apart in the graph-theoretic sense are also farther apart in Euclidean space.
