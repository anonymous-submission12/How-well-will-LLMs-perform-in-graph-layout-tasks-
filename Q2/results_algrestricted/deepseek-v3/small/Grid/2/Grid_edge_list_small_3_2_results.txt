To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a force-directed layout approach. This approach simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to position the nodes in a way that minimizes the energy of the system.

Here is a Python script that implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm:

```python
import json
import math
import random

# Define the graph as an edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 12), (1, 2), (1, 13), (2, 3), (2, 14), (3, 4), (3, 15), 
             (4, 5), (4, 16), (5, 6), (5, 17), (6, 7), (6, 18), (7, 8), (7, 19), 
             (8, 9), (8, 20), (9, 10), (9, 21), (10, 11), (10, 22), (11, 23), 
             (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), 
             (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23)]

# Number of nodes in the graph
num_nodes = 24

# Initialize node positions randomly
positions = {i: (random.uniform(0, 1), random.uniform(0, 1)) for i in range(num_nodes)}

# Parameters for the force-directed layout
k = 1.0  # Optimal distance between nodes
t = 0.1  # Temperature (controls the movement of nodes)
max_iterations = 100

# Function to calculate the Euclidean distance between two nodes
def euclidean_distance(pos1, pos2):
    return math.sqrt((pos1[0] - pos2[0])**2 + (pos1[1] - pos2[1])**2)

# Force-directed layout algorithm
for iteration in range(max_iterations):
    # Calculate repulsive forces (between all pairs of nodes)
    for i in range(num_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, num_nodes):
            dx = positions[j][0] - positions[i][0]
            dy = positions[j][1] - positions[i][1]
            distance = euclidean_distance(positions[i], positions[j])
            if distance > 0:
                force = k**2 / distance
                positions[i] = (positions[i][0] - force * dx / distance, positions[i][1] - force * dy / distance)
                positions[j] = (positions[j][0] + force * dx / distance, positions[j][1] + force * dy / distance)

    # Calculate attractive forces (between connected nodes)
    for u, v in edge_list:
        dx = positions[v][0] - positions[u][0]
        dy = positions[v][1] - positions[u][1]
        distance = euclidean_distance(positions[u], positions[v])
        if distance > 0:
            force = distance**2 / k
            positions[u] = (positions[u][0] + force * dx / distance, positions[u][1] + force * dy / distance)
            positions[v] = (positions[v][0] - force * dx / distance, positions[v][1] - force * dy / distance)

    # Reduce temperature to slow down the movement of nodes
    t *= 0.95

# Normalize positions to fit within a unit square
min_x = min(pos[0] for pos in positions.values())
min_y = min(pos[1] for pos in positions.values())
max_x = max(pos[0] for pos in positions.values())
max_y = max(pos[1] for pos in positions.values())

for node in positions:
    positions[node] = (
        (positions[node][0] - min_x) / (max_x - min_x),
        (positions[node][1] - min_y) / (max_y - min_y)
    )

# Output the layout in JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The node positions are initialized randomly within a unit square.
2. **Force Calculation**:
   - **Repulsive Forces**: Nodes repel each other to avoid overlap.
   - **Attractive Forces**: Connected nodes attract each other to maintain graph-theoretic distances.
3. **Temperature**: The temperature `t` is reduced over iterations to slow down the movement of nodes, allowing the system to settle into a stable configuration.
4. **Normalization**: The final positions are normalized to fit within a unit square.

### Output:
The script outputs the node positions in JSON format, which can be used for further processing or visualization.

```json
{
    "0": [0.123, 0.456],
    "1": [0.234, 0.567],
    ...
    "23": [0.789, 0.890]
}
```

This JSON object contains the positions of each node in the graph, where the keys are the node IDs and the values are the `(x, y)` coordinates.
