To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a force-directed layout approach. This approach simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to position the nodes in a way that minimizes edge crossings and keeps connected nodes close together.

Below is a Python script that implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm. The script will output the graph layout in JSON format.

```python
import json
import math
import random

# Define the graph as an edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 10), (3, 4), (3, 11), 
             (4, 5), (4, 12), (5, 6), (5, 13), (6, 7), (6, 14), (7, 15), (8, 9), 
             (8, 16), (9, 10), (9, 17), (10, 11), (10, 18), (11, 12), (11, 19), 
             (12, 13), (12, 20), (13, 14), (13, 21), (14, 15), (14, 22), (15, 23), 
             (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23)]

# Initialize node positions randomly
nodes = set()
for edge in edge_list:
    nodes.add(edge[0])
    nodes.add(edge[1])
nodes = list(nodes)

# Initialize positions randomly
positions = {node: (random.uniform(0, 100), random.uniform(0, 100)) for node in nodes}

# Parameters for the force-directed layout
k = 1.0  # Spring constant
repulsion_constant = 100.0  # Repulsion constant
iterations = 100
cooling_factor = 0.95

# Force-directed layout algorithm
for iteration in range(iterations):
    # Calculate repulsive forces
    for i in range(len(nodes)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nodes)):
            node1 = nodes[i]
            node2 = nodes[j]
            dx = positions[node1][0] - positions[node2][0]
            dy = positions[node1][1] - positions[node2][1]
            distance = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)
            if distance > 0:
                force = repulsion_constant / distance**2
                positions[node1] = (positions[node1][0] + force * dx / distance, 
                                   positions[node1][1] + force * dy / distance)
                positions[node2] = (positions[node2][0] - force * dx / distance, 
                                   positions[node2][1] - force * dy / distance)
    
    # Calculate attractive forces (spring forces)
    for edge in edge_list:
        node1 = edge[0]
        node2 = edge[1]
        dx = positions[node1][0] - positions[node2][0]
        dy = positions[node1][1] - positions[node2][1]
        distance = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)
        if distance > 0:
            force = k * distance
            positions[node1] = (positions[node1][0] - force * dx / distance, 
                               positions[node1][1] - force * dy / distance)
            positions[node2] = (positions[node2][0] + force * dx / distance, 
                               positions[node2][1] + force * dy / distance)
    
    # Cool down the system
    repulsion_constant *= cooling_factor

# Normalize positions to fit within a unit square
min_x = min(pos[0] for pos in positions.values())
min_y = min(pos[1] for pos in positions.values())
max_x = max(pos[0] for pos in positions.values())
max_y = max(pos[1] for pos in positions.values())

scale_x = 1.0 / (max_x - min_x) if max_x != min_x else 1.0
scale_y = 1.0 / (max_y - min_y) if max_y != min_y else 1.0

normalized_positions = {node: ((pos[0] - min_x) * scale_x, (pos[1] - min_y) * scale_y) 
                        for node, pos in positions.items()}

# Output the layout in JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(normalized_positions, indent=4)
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The nodes are initialized with random positions within a 100x100 square.
2. **Force Calculation**:
   - **Repulsive Forces**: Nodes repel each other based on the inverse square law, which helps to spread out the nodes.
   - **Attractive Forces**: Connected nodes attract each other based on Hooke's law, which helps to keep connected nodes close together.
3. **Cooling**: The repulsion constant is reduced over time to allow the system to settle into a stable configuration.
4. **Normalization**: The positions are normalized to fit within a unit square (0 to 1 in both x and y dimensions).

### Output:
The script outputs the graph layout in JSON format, where each node is mapped to its normalized position in the unit square.

```json
{
    "0": [0.123, 0.456],
    "1": [0.234, 0.567],
    ...
    "23": [0.789, 0.890]
}
```

This JSON can be used to visualize the graph or for further processing.
