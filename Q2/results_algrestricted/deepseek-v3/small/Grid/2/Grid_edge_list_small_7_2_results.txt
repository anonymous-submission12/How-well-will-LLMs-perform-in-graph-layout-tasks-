To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a simple approach where we place nodes in a grid-like structure. This approach ensures that nodes that are close in graph-theoretic distance (i.e., fewer edges between them) are also close in Euclidean distance.

Here is a Python script that generates such a layout and outputs it in JSON format:

```python
import json

# Input edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 8), (2, 3), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 10), (4, 5), (4, 11), 
    (5, 6), (5, 12), (6, 13), (7, 8), (7, 14), (8, 9), (8, 15), (9, 10), (9, 16), 
    (10, 11), (10, 17), (11, 12), (11, 18), (12, 13), (12, 19), (13, 20), (14, 15), 
    (14, 21), (15, 16), (15, 22), (16, 17), (16, 23), (17, 18), (17, 24), (18, 19), 
    (18, 25), (19, 20), (19, 26), (20, 27), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25), 
    (25, 26), (26, 27)
]

# Determine the number of nodes
nodes = set()
for edge in edge_list:
    nodes.add(edge[0])
    nodes.add(edge[1])
num_nodes = len(nodes)

# Create a grid layout
# Assuming a grid with 4 rows and 7 columns (since 4*7=28, which is close to 28 nodes)
rows = 4
cols = 7

# Generate positions for each node
positions = {}
for i in range(num_nodes):
    row = i // cols
    col = i % cols
    positions[i] = [col, row]

# Output the layout in JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Grid Layout**: The nodes are placed in a grid with 4 rows and 7 columns. This ensures that nodes are evenly spaced and that nodes that are close in graph-theoretic distance are also close in Euclidean distance.
2. **Position Calculation**: The position of each node is calculated based on its index. The `row` is determined by integer division of the node index by the number of columns, and the `col` is determined by the remainder of the division.
3. **JSON Output**: The positions are stored in a dictionary and then converted to JSON format using `json.dumps()`.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node ID and the value is a list representing the `[x, y]` coordinates of the node in the grid.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 0],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [3, 0],
    "4": [4, 0],
    "5": [5, 0],
    "6": [6, 0],
    "7": [0, 1],
    "8": [1, 1],
    "9": [2, 1],
    "10": [3, 1],
    "11": [4, 1],
    "12": [5, 1],
    "13": [6, 1],
    "14": [0, 2],
    "15": [1, 2],
    "16": [2, 2],
    "17": [3, 2],
    "18": [4, 2],
    "19": [5, 2],
    "20": [6, 2],
    "21": [0, 3],
    "22": [1, 3],
    "23": [2, 3],
    "24": [3, 3],
    "25": [4, 3],
    "26": [5, 3],
    "27": [6, 3]
}
```

This layout ensures that nodes connected by edges are close to each other in the grid, maintaining a balance between graph-theoretic and Euclidean distances.
