To generate a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear, we can use a community detection algorithm to partition the graph into communities and then assign positions to the nodes based on their community membership. Here, we will use the Louvain method for community detection, which is a popular algorithm for detecting communities in large networks.

The layout will be generated by placing nodes in a circular layout around the center of the graph, with nodes in the same community placed closer together. The positions will be stored in a JSON format.

Here is the Python script to achieve this:

```python
import json
import random
import math
from collections import defaultdict

# Define the graph as an edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 13), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 12),

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Construction**: The graph is constructed from the provided edge list.
2. **Community Detection**: The Louvain method is used to detect communities in the graph. This method iteratively optimizes the modularity of the community structure.
3. **Layout Generation**: Nodes are placed in a circular layout around the center of the graph. Nodes within the same community are placed closer together.
4. **Output**: The layout is output in JSON format, where each node is assigned an `(x, y)` position.

This script ensures that the community structure is visually clear by grouping nodes from the same community together in the layout.
