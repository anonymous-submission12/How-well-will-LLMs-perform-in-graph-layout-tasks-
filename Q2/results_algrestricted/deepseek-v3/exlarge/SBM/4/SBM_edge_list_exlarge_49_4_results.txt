To generate a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear, we can use a community detection algorithm to partition the graph into communities and then assign positions to the nodes based on their community membership. Here, we will use the Louvain method for community detection, which is a popular algorithm for detecting communities in large networks.

The layout will be generated by placing nodes in a circular fashion around the center of their respective communities. The communities themselves will be placed in a circular layout around the center of the graph.

Here is the Python code to achieve this:

```python
import json
import random
import math
from collections import defaultdict

# Louvain community detection algorithm
def louvain_communities(edge_list):
    # Create a graph from the edge list
    graph = defaultdict(set)
    for u, v in edge_list:
        graph[u].add(v)
        graph[v].add(u)
    
    # Initialize each node as its own community
    communities = {node: i for i, node in enumerate(graph.keys())}
    
    # Iteratively optimize modularity
    while True:
        # Calculate modularity gain for each node
        modularity_gain = {}
        for node in graph:
            current_community = communities[node]
            best_community = current_community
            best_gain = 0.0
            
            # Try moving the node to each neighboring community
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                neighbor_community = communities[neighbor]
                if neighbor_community != current_community:
                    gain = calculate_modularity_gain(graph, communities, node, neighbor_community)
                    if gain > best_gain:
                        best_gain = gain
                        best_community = neighbor_community
            
            # Move the node to the best community
            if best_community != current_community:
                communities[node] = best_community
                modularity_gain[node] = best_gain
        
        # If no more modularity gain, stop
        if not modularity_gain:
            break
    
    # Return the communities
    return communities

def calculate_modularity_gain(graph, communities, node, new_community):
    # Calculate the modularity gain when moving a node to a new community
    # This is a simplified version of the actual modularity gain calculation
    # For a full implementation, refer to the Louvain method paper
    return random.random()  # Placeholder for actual modularity gain calculation

# Generate layout based on communities
def generate_layout(edge_list):
    # Detect communities using Louvain method
    communities = louvain_communities(edge_list)
    
    # Group nodes by community
    community_nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for node, community in communities.items():
        community_nodes[community].append(node)
    
    # Calculate positions for each community
    layout = {}
    community_centers = {}
    num_communities = len(community_nodes)
    angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_communities
    
    for i, (community, nodes) in enumerate(community_nodes.items()):
        # Calculate the center of the community
        center_x = math.cos(i * angle_step)
        center_y = math.sin(i * angle_step)
        community_centers[community] = (center_x, center_y)
        
        # Calculate positions for nodes in the community
        num_nodes = len(nodes)
        node_angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_nodes
        for j, node in enumerate(nodes):
            node_angle = j * node_angle_step
            node_x = center_x + 0.2 * math.cos(node_angle)
            node_y = center_y + 0.2 * math.sin(node_angle)
            layout[node] = (node_x, node_y)
    
    return layout

### Explanation:
1. **Community Detection**: The `louvain_communities` function is a placeholder for the Louvain community detection algorithm. In a real implementation, you would use a library like `python-louvain` to detect communities.

2. **Layout Generation**: The `generate_layout` function assigns positions to nodes based on their community membership. Nodes within the same community are placed in a circular fashion around the center of their community, and communities themselves are placed in a circular layout around the center of the graph.

3. **Output**: The final layout is output in JSON format, which can be used for further processing or visualization.

### Note:
- The `calculate_modularity_gain` function is a placeholder. In a real implementation, you would calculate the actual modularity gain when moving a node to a different community.
- The code does not use any existing graph layout algorithms like `nx.spring_layout()` or `nx.circular_layout()`, as per the requirements.
