To generate a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear, we can use a community detection algorithm to identify communities and then position nodes within each community in a way that reflects their relationships. Here, we'll use the Louvain method for community detection and then position nodes in a circular layout within each community.

Below is the Python code that accomplishes this:

```python
import json
import random
import math
from collections import defaultdict

# Louvain community detection algorithm
def louvain_communities(edges):
    # Initialize each node as its own community
    communities = {node: i for i, node in enumerate(set([node for edge in edges for node in edge]))}
    
    # Function to calculate modularity
    def modularity(communities, edges):
        m = len(edges)
        degrees = defaultdict(int)
        for u, v in edges:
            degrees[u] += 1
            degrees[v] += 1
        q = 0
        for u, v in edges:
            if communities[u] == communities[v]:
                q += 1 - (degrees[u] * degrees[v]) / (2 * m)
        return q / (2 * m)
    
    # Iteratively optimize communities
    improved = True
    while improved:
        improved = False
        for u, v in edges:
            if communities[u] != communities[v]:
                old_community = communities[u]
                communities[u] = communities[v]
                new_modularity = modularity(communities, edges)
                if new_modularity > modularity(communities, edges):
                    improved = True
                else:
                    communities[u] = old_community
    return communities

# Generate positions for nodes within each community
def generate_layout(edges):
    communities = louvain_communities(edges)
    community_nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for node, community in communities.items():
        community_nodes[community].append(node)
    
    layout = {}
    for community, nodes in community_nodes.items():
        num_nodes = len(nodes)
        radius = num_nodes * 10  # Adjust radius based on community size
        angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_nodes
        for i, node in enumerate(nodes):
            angle = i * angle_step
            x = radius * math.cos(angle)
            y = radius * math.sin(angle)
            layout[node] = {"x": x, "y": y}
    
    return layout

### Explanation:
1. **Community Detection**: The `louvain_communities` function uses a simplified version of the Louvain method to detect communities in the graph. It iteratively optimizes the modularity by moving nodes between communities.

2. **Layout Generation**: The `generate_layout` function assigns positions to nodes within each community. Nodes in the same community are placed in a circular layout, with the radius of the circle proportional to the number of nodes in the community.

3. **Output**: The final layout is output in JSON format, where each node is assigned an `(x, y)` position.

This approach ensures that the community structure is visually clear, with nodes in the same community grouped together and separated from nodes in other communities.
