To generate a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear, we can use a community detection algorithm to partition the graph into communities and then assign positions to the nodes based on their community membership. Here, we will use the Louvain method for community detection, which is a popular algorithm for detecting communities in large networks.

The layout will be generated by placing nodes in a circular fashion around the center of their respective communities. The communities themselves will be placed in a circular layout around the center of the graph.

Here is the Python code to achieve this:

```python
import json
import random
import math
from collections import defaultdict

# Louvain community detection algorithm
def louvain_communities(edge_list):
    # Create a graph from the edge list
    graph = defaultdict(set)
    for u, v in edge_list:
        graph[u].add(v)
        graph[v].add(u)
    
    # Initialize each node as its own community
    communities = {node: i for i, node in enumerate(graph.keys())}
    
    # Iteratively optimize communities
    while True:
        # Calculate modularity gain for each node
        new_communities = communities.copy()
        for node in graph:
            best_community = communities[node]
            best_gain = 0
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if communities[neighbor] != communities[node]:
                    gain = calculate_modularity_gain(graph, communities, node, communities[neighbor])
                    if gain > best_gain:
                        best_gain = gain
                        best_community = communities[neighbor]
            new_communities[node] = best_community
        
        # Check if communities have changed
        if new_communities == communities:
            break
        communities = new_communities
    
    # Group nodes by community
    community_dict = defaultdict(list)
    for node, community in communities.items():
        community_dict[community].append(node)
    
    return list(community_dict.values())

def calculate_modularity_gain(graph, communities, node, new_community):
    # Calculate the modularity gain when moving node to new_community
    # This is a simplified version, actual implementation would be more complex
    return random.random()  # Placeholder for actual modularity gain calculation

# Generate positions for nodes based on communities
def generate_layout(communities):
    layout = {}
    center = (0, 0)
    radius = 100
    angle_step = 2 * math.pi / len(communities)
    
    for i, community in enumerate(communities):
        community_center = (
            center[0] + radius * math.cos(i * angle_step),
            center[1] + radius * math.sin(i * angle_step)
        )
        community_radius = 50
        community_angle_step = 2 * math.pi / len(community)
        
        for j, node in enumerate(community):
            angle = j * community_angle_step
            layout[node] = (
                community_center[0] + community_radius * math.cos(angle),
                community_center[1] + community_radius * math.sin(angle)
            )
    
    return layout

### Explanation:
1. **Community Detection**: The `louvain_communities` function uses a simplified version of the Louvain method to detect communities in the graph. This function groups nodes into communities based on their connections.

2. **Layout Generation**: The `generate_layout` function places each community in a circular layout around the center of the graph. Nodes within each community are also placed in a circular fashion around the center of their respective community.

3. **Output**: The final layout is output in JSON format, where each node is mapped to its position in the 2D plane.

### Note:
- The `calculate_modularity_gain` function is a placeholder. In a real implementation, you would need to calculate the actual modularity gain when moving a node to a different community.
- The layout generation assumes that the graph is connected. If the graph is disconnected, you may need to handle each connected component separately.

This code provides a basic framework for generating a graph layout that respects community structure. You can further refine the community detection and layout generation algorithms based on your specific needs.
