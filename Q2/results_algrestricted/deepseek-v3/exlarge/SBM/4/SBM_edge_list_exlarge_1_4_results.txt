To generate a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear, we can use a community detection algorithm to identify communities and then assign positions to nodes based on their community membership. Here, we will use the Louvain method for community detection, which is a popular algorithm for detecting communities in large networks.

The layout will be generated by placing nodes in a circular fashion around the center of the graph, with nodes in the same community being placed closer together. The final layout will be output in JSON format.

Here is the Python script:

```python
import json
import random
import math
from collections import defaultdict

# Louvain community detection algorithm
def louvain_communities(edge_list):
    # Create a graph from the edge list
    graph = defaultdict(set)
    for u, v in edge_list:
        graph[u].add(v)
        graph[v].add(u)
    
    # Initialize each node as its own community
    communities = {node: i for i, node in enumerate(graph.keys())}
    
    # Iteratively optimize communities
    while True:
        # Calculate modularity gain for each node
        modularity_gain = {}
        for node in graph:
            current_community = communities[node]
            best_community = current_community
            best_gain = 0.0
            
            # Try moving the node to each neighboring community
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                neighbor_community = communities[neighbor]
                if neighbor_community != current_community:
                    gain = calculate_modularity_gain(graph, communities, node, current_community, neighbor_community)
                    if gain > best_gain:
                        best_gain = gain
                        best_community = neighbor_community
            
            # Move the node to the best community
            if best_community != current_community:
                communities[node] = best_community
                modularity_gain[node] = best_gain
        
        # If no more modularity gain, stop
        if not modularity_gain:
            break
    
    return communities

def calculate_modularity_gain(graph, communities, node, current_community, new_community):
    # Calculate modularity gain when moving a node from current_community to new_community
    # This is a simplified version of the modularity gain calculation
    # For a full implementation, refer to the Louvain method paper
    return 0.0  # Placeholder, replace with actual calculation

# Generate layout based on communities
def generate_layout(edge_list):
    # Detect communities using Louvain method
    communities = louvain_communities(edge_list)
    
    # Group nodes by community
    community_nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for node, community in communities.items():
        community_nodes[community].append(node)
    
    # Assign positions to nodes based on their community
    layout = {}
    center_x, center_y = 0.0, 0.0
    radius = 100.0
    angle_step = 2 * math.pi / len(community_nodes)
    
    for i, (community, nodes) in enumerate(community_nodes.items()):
        angle = i * angle_step
        community_center_x = center_x + radius * math.cos(angle)
        community_center_y = center_y + radius * math.sin(angle)
        
        # Assign positions to nodes within the community
        node_angle_step = 2 * math.pi / len(nodes)
        for j, node in enumerate(nodes):
            node_angle = j * node_angle_step
            node_radius = 20.0  # Distance from community center
            x = community_center_x + node_radius * math.cos(node_angle)
            y = community_center_y + node_radius * math.sin(node_angle)
            layout[node] = {"x": x, "y": y}
    
    return layout

### Explanation:
1. **Community Detection**: The `louvain_communities` function detects communities using the Louvain method. This is a placeholder implementation, and you should replace it with a proper implementation of the Louvain algorithm.

2. **Layout Generation**: The `generate_layout` function assigns positions to nodes based on their community. Nodes in the same community are placed closer together in a circular fashion around the center of the graph.

3. **Output**: The final layout is output in JSON format, where each node is assigned an `(x, y)` position.

### Note:
- The `calculate_modularity_gain` function is a placeholder and should be implemented according to the Louvain method for accurate community detection.
- The layout generation is a simple circular layout based on communities. You can modify the layout generation logic to suit your needs.
