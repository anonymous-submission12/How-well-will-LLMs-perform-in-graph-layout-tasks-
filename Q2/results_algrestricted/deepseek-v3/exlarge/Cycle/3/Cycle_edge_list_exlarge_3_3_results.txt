To generate a layout for the graph that minimizes edge crossings, we can use a simple approach where we arrange the nodes in a circular layout. This is a common method to reduce edge crossings, especially for graphs that are not highly interconnected.

Here is a Python script that generates a circular layout for the given graph and outputs the layout in JSON format:

```python
import json
import math

def generate_circular_layout(edge_list):
    # Extract unique nodes from the edge list
    nodes = sorted(set([node for edge in edge_list for node in edge]))
    
    # Calculate the positions for each node in a circular layout
    num_nodes = len(nodes)
    radius = 100  # Radius of the circle
    center = (0, 0)  # Center of the circle
    angle_increment = 2 * math.pi / num_nodes
    
    layout = {}
    for i, node in enumerate(nodes):
        angle = i * angle_increment
        x = center[0] + radius * math.cos(angle)
        y = center[1] + radius * math.sin(angle)
        layout[node] = (x, y)
    
    return layout

# Input edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 72), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26), (26, 27), (27, 28), (28, 29), (29, 30), (30, 31), (31, 32), (32, 33), (33, 34), (34, 35), (35, 36), (36, 37), (37, 38), (38, 39), (39, 40), (40, 41), (41, 42), (42, 43), (43, 44), (44, 45), (45, 46), (46, 47), (47, 48), (48, 49), (49, 50), (50, 51), (51, 52), (52, 53), (53, 54), (54, 55), (55, 56), (56, 57), (57, 58), (58, 59), (59, 60), (60, 61), (61, 62), (62, 63), (63, 64), (64, 65), (65, 66), (66, 67), (67, 68), (68, 69), (69, 70), (70, 71), (71, 72)]

# Generate the layout
layout = generate_circular_layout(edge_list)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node Extraction**: The script first extracts all unique nodes from the edge list.
2. **Circular Layout Calculation**: The nodes are then placed on a circle with a given radius. The angle between each node is calculated based on the total number of nodes.
3. **Position Calculation**: The x and y coordinates for each node are calculated using trigonometric functions (`math.cos` and `math.sin`).
4. **JSON Output**: The final layout is output in JSON format, where each node is mapped to its corresponding (x, y) position.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node, and the value is a tuple representing the (x, y) position of that node on the circle.

This approach minimizes edge crossings by arranging nodes in a circular fashion, which is particularly effective for graphs with a linear or chain-like structure, as in the provided edge list.
