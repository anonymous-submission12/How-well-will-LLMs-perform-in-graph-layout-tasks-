To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a simple approach where we place nodes in a circular layout. This ensures that the Euclidean distance between connected nodes is consistent with their graph-theoretic distance.

Here's a Python script that generates the layout and outputs it in JSON format:

```python
import json
import math

def generate_circular_layout(edge_list):
    # Extract unique nodes from the edge list
    nodes = set()
    for edge in edge_list:
        nodes.add(edge[0])
        nodes.add(edge[1])
    nodes = sorted(list(nodes))
    
    # Calculate the angle between each node
    num_nodes = len(nodes)
    angle_increment = (2 * math.pi) / num_nodes
    
    # Calculate the positions for each node
    radius = 100  # Radius of the circle
    layout = {}
    for i, node in enumerate(nodes):
        angle = i * angle_increment
        x = radius * math.cos(angle)
        y = radius * math.sin(angle)
        layout[node] = {"x": x, "y": y}
    
    return layout

# Input edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 74), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26), (26, 27), (27, 28), (28, 29), (29, 30), (30, 31), (31, 32), (32, 33), (33, 34), (34, 35), (35, 36), (36, 37), (37, 38), (38, 39), (39, 40), (40, 41), (41, 42), (42, 43), (43, 44), (44, 45), (45, 46), (46, 47), (47, 48), (48, 49), (49, 50), (50, 51), (51, 52), (52, 53), (53, 54), (54, 55), (55, 56), (56, 57), (57, 58), (58, 59), (59, 60), (60, 61), (61, 62), (62, 63), (63, 64), (64, 65), (65, 66), (66, 67), (67, 68), (68, 69), (69, 70), (70, 71), (71, 72), (72, 73), (73, 74)]

# Generate the layout
layout = generate_circular_layout(edge_list)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Node Extraction**: The script first extracts all unique nodes from the edge list.
2. **Circular Layout**: The nodes are placed in a circular layout. The angle between each node is calculated based on the total number of nodes.
3. **Position Calculation**: The positions of the nodes are calculated using trigonometric functions (`math.cos` and `math.sin`) to place them on the circumference of a circle.
4. **JSON Output**: The final layout is output in JSON format, where each node is mapped to its `(x, y)` coordinates.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node, and the value is a dictionary containing the `x` and `y` coordinates of that node.

```json
{
    "0": {
        "x": 100.0,
        "y": 0.0
    },
    "1": {
        "x": 99.24078000000001,
        "y": 13.743499999999999
    },
    "2": {
        "x": 96.96294000000001,
        "y": 27.4335
    },
    ...
    "74": {
        "x": 99.24078000000001,
        "y": -13.743499999999999
    }
}
```

This layout ensures that the Euclidean distance between connected nodes is consistent with their graph-theoretic distance, as nodes are placed uniformly around a circle.
