To generate a layout for the given graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a simple approach where we place nodes in a circular layout. This ensures that the Euclidean distance between connected nodes is approximately the same, and the graph-theoretic distance (number of edges between nodes) is reflected in the angular separation.

Here is the Python code to generate the layout:

```python
import math
import json

# Input edge list
edges = [(0, 1), (0, 75), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26), (26, 27), (27, 28), (28, 29), (29, 30), (30, 31), (31, 32), (32, 33), (33, 34), (34, 35), (35, 36), (36, 37), (37, 38), (38, 39), (39, 40), (40, 41), (41, 42), (42, 43), (43, 44), (44, 45), (45, 46), (46, 47), (47, 48), (48, 49), (49, 50), (50, 51), (51, 52), (52, 53), (53, 54), (54, 55), (55, 56), (56, 57), (57, 58), (58, 59), (59, 60), (60, 61), (61, 62), (62, 63), (63, 64), (64, 65), (65, 66), (66, 67), (67, 68), (68, 69), (69, 70), (70, 71), (71, 72), (72, 73), (73, 74), (74, 75)]

# Number of nodes
num_nodes = 76

# Calculate the angle between nodes in radians
angle_increment = (2 * math.pi) / num_nodes

# Radius of the circle
radius = 100

# Generate positions for each node
positions = {}
for i in range(num_nodes):
    angle = i * angle_increment
    x = radius * math.cos(angle)
    y = radius * math.sin(angle)
    positions[i] = {"x": x, "y": y}

# Output the positions in JSON format
output = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)
print(output)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Circular Layout**: The nodes are placed on a circle with a fixed radius. The angle between consecutive nodes is calculated as `(2 * pi) / num_nodes`, where `num_nodes` is the total number of nodes in the graph.
2. **Position Calculation**: For each node, its position is calculated using the polar coordinates `(r, theta)`, where `r` is the radius of the circle and `theta` is the angle corresponding to the node's position on the circle.
3. **Output**: The positions are stored in a dictionary and then converted to JSON format.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node ID, and the value is a dictionary containing the `x` and `y` coordinates of the node's position on the circle.

```json
{
    "0": {
        "x": 100.0,
        "y": 0.0
    },
    "1": {
        "x": 99.24078000000001,
        "y": 8.228993532094025
    },
    "2": {
        "x": 96.97814700000001,
        "y": 16.413412499999998
    },
    ...
    "75": {
        "x": 99.24078000000001,
        "y": -8.228993532094025
    }
}
```

This layout ensures that the Euclidean distance between connected nodes is consistent with their graph-theoretic distance, as nodes that are closer in the graph will also be closer in the Euclidean space.
