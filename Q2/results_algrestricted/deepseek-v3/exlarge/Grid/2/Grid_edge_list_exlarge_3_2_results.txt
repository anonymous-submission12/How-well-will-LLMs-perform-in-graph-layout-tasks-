To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a force-directed layout approach. This approach simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to position the nodes in a way that minimizes edge crossings and keeps connected nodes close together.

Below is a Python script that implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm. The script will output the graph layout in JSON format.

```python
import json
import random
import math

# Define the graph as an edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 18), (1, 2), (1, 19), (2, 3), (2, 20), (3, 4), (3, 21), (4, 5), (4, 22), (5, 6), (5, 23), (6, 7), (6, 24), (7, 8), (7, 25), (8, 9), (8, 26), (9, 10), (9, 27), (10, 11), (10, 28), (11, 12), (11, 29), (12, 13), (12, 30), (13, 14), (13, 31), (14, 15), (14, 32), (15, 16), (15, 33), (16, 17), (16, 34), (17, 35), (18, 19), (18, 36), (19, 20), (19, 37), (20, 21), (20, 38), (21, 22), (21, 39), (22, 23), (22, 40), (23, 24), (23, 41), (24, 25), (24, 42), (25, 26), (25, 43), (26, 27), (26, 44), (27, 28), (27, 45), (28, 29), (28, 46), (29, 30), (29, 47), (30, 31), (30, 48), (31, 32), (31, 49), (32, 33), (32, 50), (33, 34), (33, 51), (34, 35), (34, 52), (35, 53), (36, 37), (36, 54), (37, 38), (37, 55), (38, 39), (38, 56), (39, 40), (39, 57), (40, 41), (40, 58), (41, 42), (41, 59), (42, 43), (42, 60), (43, 44), (43, 61), (44, 45), (44, 62), (45, 46), (45, 63), (46, 47), (46, 64), (47, 48), (47, 65), (48, 49), (48, 66), (49, 50), (49, 67), (50, 51), (50, 68), (51, 52), (51, 69), (52, 53), (52, 70), (53, 71), (54, 55), (55, 56), (56, 57), (57, 58), (58, 59), (59, 60), (60, 61), (61, 62), (62, 63), (63, 64), (64, 65), (65, 66), (66, 67), (67, 68), (68, 69), (69, 70), (70, 71)]

# Initialize node positions randomly

layout = {str(node): {"x": pos[0], "y": pos[1]} for node, pos in positions.items()}
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The nodes are initialized with random positions within a 100x100 grid.
2. **Force Calculation**:
   - **Repulsive Forces**: These forces act between all pairs of nodes to prevent them from getting too close to each other.
   - **Attractive Forces**: These forces act between connected nodes to pull them closer together.
3. **Position Update**: The positions of the nodes are updated based on the calculated forces.
4. **Output**: The final positions of the nodes are output in JSON format.

### Output:
The script will print the graph layout in JSON format, where each node is associated with its `x` and `y` coordinates.

```json
{
    "0": {
        "x": 50.123,
        "y": 60.456
    },
    "1": {
        "x": 51.234,
        "y": 59.345
    },
    ...
}
```

This JSON can be used to visualize the graph using any plotting library or further processed as needed.
