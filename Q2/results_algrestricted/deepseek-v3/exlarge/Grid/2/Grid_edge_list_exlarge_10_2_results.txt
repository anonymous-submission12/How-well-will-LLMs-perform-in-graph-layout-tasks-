To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a force-directed layout approach. This approach simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to position the nodes in a way that minimizes edge crossings and keeps connected nodes close together.

Below is a Python script that implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm. The script will output the graph layout in JSON format.

```python
import json
import random
import math

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The positions of the nodes are initialized randomly within a unit square.
2. **Force Calculation**:
   - **Repulsion Forces**: All pairs of nodes repel each other, with the force inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
   - **Attraction Forces**: Connected nodes attract each other, with the force proportional to the distance between them.
3. **Position Update**: The positions of the nodes are updated based on the calculated forces.
4. **Cooling**: The repulsion constant is reduced over time to allow the system to settle into a stable configuration.
5. **Output**: The final positions of the nodes are output in JSON format.

This script provides a basic force-directed layout that should give a reasonable representation of the graph. You can adjust parameters like `k`, `repulsion_constant`, and `iterations` to fine-tune the layout.
