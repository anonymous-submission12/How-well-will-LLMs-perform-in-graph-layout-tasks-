To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a force-directed layout approach. This approach simulates physical forces between nodes and edges to position the nodes in a way that minimizes edge crossings and keeps connected nodes close together.

Below is a Python script that implements a simple force-directed layout algorithm. The script will output the graph layout in JSON format.

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The nodes are initialized with random positions within a 100x100 grid.
2. **Force Calculation**:
   - **Repulsive Forces**: These forces act between all pairs of nodes to prevent them from getting too close to each other.
   - **Attractive Forces**: These forces act between connected nodes to pull them closer together.
3. **Position Update**: The positions of the nodes are updated based on the calculated forces.
4. **Output**: The final positions of the nodes are output in JSON format.

This script will generate a layout that attempts to maintain a balance between the Euclidean distance and the graph-theoretic distance, resulting in a visually pleasing and meaningful graph layout.
