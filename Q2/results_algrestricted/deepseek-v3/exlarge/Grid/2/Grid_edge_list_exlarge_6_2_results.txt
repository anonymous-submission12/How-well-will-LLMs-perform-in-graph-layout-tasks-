To generate a layout for the graph that maintains consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a simple approach where we place nodes in a grid-like structure. The idea is to assign positions to nodes such that nodes connected by edges are close to each other in Euclidean space, while nodes that are not directly connected are farther apart.

Here's a Python script that generates a layout for the given graph:

```python
import json
import math

# Input edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 39), (1, 2), (1, 40), (2, 3), (2, 41), (3, 4), (3, 42), (4, 5), (4, 43),
    (5, 6), (5, 44), (6, 7), (6, 45), (7, 8), (7, 46), (8, 9), (8, 47), (9, 10), (9, 48),
    (10, 11), (10, 49), (11, 12), (11, 50), (12, 13), (12, 51), (13, 14), (13, 52), (14, 15),
    (14, 53), (15, 16), (15, 54), (16, 17), (16, 55), (17, 18), (17, 56), (18, 19), (18, 57),
    (19, 20), (19, 58), (20, 21), (20, 59), (21, 22), (21, 60), (22, 23), (22, 61), (23, 24),
    (23, 62), (24, 25), (24, 63), (25, 26), (25, 64), (26, 27), (26, 65), (27, 28), (27, 66),
    (28, 29), (28, 67), (29, 30), (29, 68), (30, 31), (30, 69), (31, 32), (31, 70), (32, 33),
    (32, 71), (33, 34), (33, 72), (34, 35), (34, 73), (35, 36), (35, 74), (36, 37), (36, 75),
    (37, 38), (37, 76), (38, 77), (39, 40), (40, 41), (41, 42), (42, 43), (43, 44), (44, 45),
    (45, 46), (46, 47), (47, 48), (48, 49), (49, 50), (50, 51), (51, 52), (52, 53), (53, 54),
    (54, 55), (55, 56), (56, 57), (57, 58), (58, 59), (59, 60), (60, 61), (61, 62), (62, 63),
    (63, 64), (64, 65), (65, 66), (66, 67), (67, 68), (68, 69), (69, 70), (70, 71), (71, 72),
    (72, 73), (73, 74), (74, 75), (75, 76), (76, 77)
]

# Determine the number of nodes
nodes = set()
for edge in edge_list:
    nodes.add(edge[0])
    nodes.add(edge[1])
num_nodes = len(nodes)

# Calculate the grid size
grid_size = int(math.ceil(math.sqrt(num_nodes)))

# Assign positions to nodes in a grid-like structure
positions = {}
for i, node in enumerate(sorted(nodes)):
    row = i // grid_size
    col = i % grid_size
    positions[node] = {"x": col, "y": row}

# Output the layout in JSON format
output = {"nodes": positions}
print(json.dumps(output, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Edge List Input**: The edge list is provided as input.
2. **Node Extraction**: We extract all unique nodes from the edge list.
3. **Grid Size Calculation**: We calculate the size of the grid needed to place all nodes. The grid size is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the square root of the number of nodes.
4. **Position Assignment**: We assign positions to nodes in a grid-like structure. Each node is placed in a cell of the grid, with `(x, y)` coordinates corresponding to its column and row in the grid.
5. **JSON Output**: The positions of the nodes are output in JSON format.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each node is mapped to its `(x, y)` position in the grid. For example:

```json
{
    "nodes": {
        "0": {"x": 0, "y": 0},
        "1": {"x": 1, "y": 0},
        "2": {"x": 2, "y": 0},
        ...
        "77": {"x": 8, "y": 8}
    }
}
```

This layout ensures that nodes connected by edges are generally close to each other in Euclidean space, while nodes that are not directly connected are farther apart.
