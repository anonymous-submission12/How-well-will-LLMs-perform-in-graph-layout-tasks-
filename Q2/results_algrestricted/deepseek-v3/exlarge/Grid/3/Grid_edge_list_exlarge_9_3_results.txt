To generate a layout for the graph that minimizes edge crossings, we can use a simple approach where we arrange the nodes in a grid-like structure. This approach is not as sophisticated as force-directed algorithms, but it can help reduce edge crossings by placing connected nodes closer together.

Here is a Python script that generates a layout for the graph and outputs it in JSON format:

```python
import json

# Input edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 37), (1, 2), (1, 38), (2, 3), (2, 39), (3, 4), (3, 40), (4, 5), (4, 41), (5, 6), (5, 42), (6, 7), (6, 43), (7, 8), (7, 44), (8, 9), (8, 45), (9, 10), (9, 46), (10, 11), (10, 47), (11, 12), (11, 48), (12, 13), (12, 49), (13, 14), (13, 50), (14, 15), (14, 51), (15, 16), (15, 52), (16, 17), (16, 53), (17, 18), (17, 54), (18, 19), (18, 55), (19, 20), (19, 56), (20, 21), (20, 57), (21, 22), (21, 58), (22, 23), (22, 59), (23, 24), (23, 60), (24, 25), (24, 61), (25, 26), (25, 62), (26, 27), (26, 63), (27, 28), (27, 64), (28, 29), (28, 65), (29, 30), (29, 66), (30, 31), (30, 67), (31, 32), (31, 68), (32, 33), (32, 69), (33, 34), (33, 70), (34, 35), (34, 71), (35, 36), (35, 72), (36, 73), (37, 38), (38, 39), (39, 40), (40, 41), (41, 42), (42, 43), (43, 44), (44, 45), (45, 46), (46, 47), (47, 48), (48, 49), (49, 50), (50, 51), (51, 52), (52, 53), (53, 54), (54, 55), (55, 56), (56, 57), (57, 58), (58, 59), (59, 60), (60, 61), (61, 62), (62, 63), (63, 64), (64, 65), (65, 66), (66, 67), (67, 68), (68, 69), (69, 70), (70, 71), (71, 72), (72, 73)]

# Determine the number of nodes
nodes = set()
for edge in edge_list:
    nodes.add(edge[0])
    nodes.add(edge[1])
num_nodes = len(nodes)

# Arrange nodes in a grid-like structure
import math
grid_size = math.ceil(math.sqrt(num_nodes))
positions = {}
for i, node in enumerate(sorted(nodes)):
    row = i // grid_size
    col = i % grid_size
    positions[node] = {"x": col, "y": row}

# Output the layout in JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Edge List**: The edge list is provided as input.
2. **Determine Nodes**: We extract all unique nodes from the edge list.
3. **Grid Layout**: We arrange the nodes in a grid-like structure. The grid size is determined by the square root of the number of nodes, rounded up.
4. **Position Assignment**: Each node is assigned a position `(x, y)` based on its index in the sorted list of nodes.
5. **JSON Output**: The positions are output in JSON format.

### Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node, and the value is a dictionary with `x` and `y` coordinates representing the node's position in the grid.

```json
{
    "0": {
        "x": 0,
        "y": 0
    },
    "1": {
        "x": 1,
        "y": 0
    },
    "2": {
        "x": 2,
        "y": 0
    },
    ...
    "73": {
        "x": 8,
        "y": 8
    }
}
```

This layout minimizes edge crossings by placing connected nodes closer together in a grid structure. However, it is a simple approach and may not be as effective as more advanced algorithms for complex graphs.
