To achieve a graph layout where the Euclidean distance corresponds to the graph-theoretic distance, we can incrementally place vertices along a straight line, ensuring that the distance between consecutive vertices is consistent. Below is the Python code to generate such a layout and output the result in JSON format:

```python
import json

# Input graph edges
edges = [
    (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9),
    (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), 
    (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), 
    (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26), (26, 27), (27, 28), (28, 29), (29, 30), 
    (30, 31), (31, 32), (32, 33), (33, 34), (34, 35), (35, 36), (36, 37), 
    (37, 38), (38, 39), (39, 40), (40, 41), (41, 42), (42, 43), (43, 44), 
    (44, 45), (45, 46), (46, 47), (47, 48), (48, 49), (49, 50), (50, 51), 
    (51, 52), (52, 53), (53, 54), (54, 55), (55, 56), (56, 57), (57, 58), 
    (58, 59), (59, 60), (60, 61), (61, 62), (62, 63), (63, 64), (64, 65), 
    (65, 66), (66, 67), (67, 68), (68, 69), (69, 70), (70, 71), (71, 72), 
    (72, 73), (73, 74), (74, 75)
]

# Generate layout
def generate_positions(edge_list):
    positions = {}
    step = 1  # Distance between consecutive vertices
    for i, edge in enumerate(edge_list):
        # Place vertex positions based on their graph-theoretic distance
        if edge[0] not in positions:
            positions[edge[0]] = [edge[0] * step, 0]  # Align along x-axis
        if edge[1] not in positions:
            positions[edge[1]] = [edge[1] * step, 0]  # Align along x-axis
    return positions

positions = generate_positions(edges)

# Convert to JSON format
positions_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)
print(positions_json)
``` 

### Explanation of Code:
1. **Input Graph**: The input is a list of edges representing a connected graph.
2. **Step Size**: The Euclidean distance between consecutive vertices on the line is kept constant (`step = 1`).
3. **Positions**:
   - Vertices are placed incrementally along the x-axis, with their position proportional to their graph-theoretic distance from the start vertex (`x = vertex_id * step, y = 0`).
4. **JSON Format**: Outputs the positions of vertices in JSON format with vertex IDs as keys.

Output example (truncated):
```json
{
    "0": [0, 0],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [3, 0],
    ...
}
```
