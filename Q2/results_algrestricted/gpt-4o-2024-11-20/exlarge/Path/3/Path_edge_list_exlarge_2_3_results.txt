To generate a layout that minimizes edge crossings without using existing layout algorithms, we can take a more simplistic approach by arranging the nodes sequentially in a line. Since your graph represents a path with consecutive nodes, this strategy will naturally result in no edge crossings.

Given that the graph data is essentially a path graph (a single line of connected nodes), positioning each node incrementally along a line will ensure minimal crossings.

Here's a Python script to assign positions to each node and output it in JSON format:

```python
import json

def generate_linear_layout(edge_list):
    # Extract all unique nodes
    nodes = set()
    for edge in edge_list:
        nodes.update(edge)
    
    # Sort the nodes
    sorted_nodes = sorted(nodes)
    
    # Assign positions along a line
    positions = {}
    for i, node in enumerate(sorted_nodes):
        positions[node] = (i, 0)  # Place nodes at spaced intervals on the x-axis
    
    return positions

edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), 
    (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), 
    (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), 
    (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26), (26, 27), (27, 28), (28, 29), (29, 30), 
    (30, 31), (31, 32), (32, 33), (33, 34), (34, 35), (35, 36), (36, 37), 
    (37, 38), (38, 39), (39, 40), (40, 41), (41, 42), (42, 43), (43, 44), 
    (44, 45), (45, 46), (46, 47), (47, 48), (48, 49), (49, 50), (50, 51), 
    (51, 52), (52, 53), (53, 54), (54, 55), (55, 56), (56, 57), (57, 58), 
    (58, 59), (59, 60), (60, 61), (61, 62), (62, 63), (63, 64), (64, 65), 
    (65, 66), (66, 67), (67, 68), (68, 69), (69, 70), (70, 71)
]

positions = generate_linear_layout(edge_list)

# Output the positions in JSON format
print(json.dumps(positions, indent=2))
```

This script will output JSON containing node positions that can be visualized as a straight line, minimizing edge crossings by design.
