Below is a Python script to generate a layout for the given graph. The layout minimizes edge crossings by iteratively improving the arrangement of nodes based on a simple heuristic method. For simplicity, Iâ€™ve created a layout that assigns nodes positions along a line and then iteratively adjusts their positions to avoid crossings.

```python
import json

def minimize_edge_crossings(edge_list):
    # Extract unique nodes
    nodes = set()
    for edge in edge_list:
        nodes.update(edge)
    nodes = list(nodes)
    
    # Initialize positions along a straight line
    positions = {node: [index, 0] for index, node in enumerate(nodes)}
    
    def count_edge_crossings(positions, edge_list):
        """Helper function to count edge crossings."""
        crossings = 0
        for i in range(len(edge_list)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(edge_list)):
                a, b = edge_list[i]
                c, d = edge_list[j]
                pos_a, pos_b = sorted([positions[a], positions[b]])
                pos_c, pos_d = sorted([positions[c], positions[d]])
                
                # Check if edges (a, b) and (c, d) cross
                if pos_a[0] < pos_c[0] < pos_b[0] < pos_d[0]:
                    crossings += 1
                elif pos_c[0] < pos_a[0] < pos_d[0] < pos_b[0]:
                    crossings += 1
        return crossings

    # Iteratively improve positions to reduce crossings
    has_improved = True
    while has_improved:
        has_improved = False
        for i in range(len(nodes) - 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nodes)):
                # Swap two nodes and see if it reduces crossings
                nodes[i], nodes[j] = nodes[j], nodes[i]
                new_positions = {node: [index, 0] for index, node in enumerate(nodes)}
                new_crossings = count_edge_crossings(new_positions, edge_list)
                current_crossings = count_edge_crossings(positions, edge_list)
                if new_crossings < current_crossings:
                    positions = new_positions
                    has_improved = True
                else:
                    # Revert swap if not better
                    nodes[i], nodes[j] = nodes[j], nodes[i]
    
    return positions

# Input graph as an edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 77), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8),

# Generate layout
layout = minimize_edge_crossings(edge_list)

# Output layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=2))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Positioning**: The nodes are placed linearly, with X-coordinates incremented by 1 and Y-coordinates set to 0.
2. **Crossing Minimization**: An iterative pairwise swapping approach is used. Swapping nodes reduces edge crossings if the new configuration has fewer crossings than the previous one.
3. **Output**: The layout is produced as a dictionary with node IDs as keys and positions (`[x, y]`) as values.
4. **JSON Output**: Finally, the positions are serialized into JSON format for output. You can adjust or expand the algorithm as needed for more complex heuristics.
