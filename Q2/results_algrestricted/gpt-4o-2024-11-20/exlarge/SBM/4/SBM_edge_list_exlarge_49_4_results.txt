Below is the Python code to generate a graph layout based on the provided edge list. The code uses a modularity-based community detection algorithm to identify communities and assigns positions to nodes such that the community structure is clear. The final output is the graph layout in JSON format.

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import json

def generate_graph_layout(edge_list):
    # Create the graph from the edge list
    G = nx.Graph()
    G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

    # Detect communities using the Louvain method
    partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

    # Group nodes by community
    communities = {}
    for node, community_id in partition.items():
        if community_id not in communities:
            communities[community_id] = []
        communities[community_id].append(node)

    # Assign positions to nodes based on their community
    positions = {}
    community_centers = {}
    radius = 10  # Distance between communities
    angle_step = 2 * 3.14159 / len(communities)  # Angle step for community placement

    # Place communities in a circular layout
    for i, (community_id, nodes) in enumerate(communities.items()):
        angle = i * angle_step
        center_x = radius * (i + 1) * 0
