Below is a Python script designed to generate a custom layout for a graph based on the input edge list while preserving community structure. The script uses a modularity-based community detection algorithm to identify communities, then assigns positions to the nodes to reflect their community memberships.

```python
import networkx as nx
import community
import json
import random
import math

def generate_custom_layout(edge_list):
    # Create a graph from the edge list
    G = nx.Graph()
    G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

    # Detect communities using the Louvain modularity-based method
    partition = community.best_partition(G)

    # Group nodes by their communities
    communities = {}
    for node, comm in partition.items():
        if comm not in communities:
            communities[comm] = []
        communities[comm].append(node)

    # Define layout dimensions and properties
    num_communities = len(communities)
    radius = 10
    angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_communities

    positions = {}

    # Assign positions to the nodes based on communities
    for i, (community_id, nodes) in enumerate(communities.items()):
        # Central position of community i
        center_x = math.cos(i * angle_step) * radius
        center_y = math.sin(i * angle_step) * radius
        
        # Position nodes within their community in a small circular pattern
        community_radius = 3  # Smaller radius for nodes within the community
        community_angle_step = 2 * math.pi / len(nodes)
        
        for j, node in enumerate(nodes):
            node_x = center_x + community_radius * math.cos(j * community_angle_step)
            node_y = center_y + community_radius * math.sin(j * community_angle_step)
            positions[node] = (node_x, node_y)
    
    # Return positions as a JSON object
    return json.dumps(positions, indent=4)

# Example usage
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 7), (0, 9), (0, 12), (0, 13), (0, 15), (0, 71), (1, 3), (1, 4), 
    (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 9), (2, 12), 
    (2, 67), (3, 4), (3, 9), (3, 10), (3, 12), (3, 13), (3, 15), (3, 69), (4, 7), (4, 8), 
    (4, 11), (4, 14), (5, 11), (5, 14), (5, 15), (6, 7), (6, 10), (6, 12), (6, 13), (6, 15),
    # ... (shortened for brevity; include complete edge list)
]

layout_json = generate_custom_layout(edge_list)
print(layout_json)
```

### Key Aspects of the Code:
1. **Community Detection**:
   - The `community.best_partition` function (from the `python-louvain` library) detects communities based on modularity optimization.
   - Nodes are grouped into communities.

2. **Custom Layout**:
   - Each community is allocated to a specific region of the 2D space, forming a larger circle for communities.
   - Within each community, nodes are arranged in a smaller circle around the community center.

3. **Output**:
   - The positions of nodes are returned as a JSON string, with node coordinates (x, y) to represent the layout.

4. **JSON Format**:
   - The output JSON format ensures compatibility for further usage in downstream tasks or visualization in other frameworks.

5. **Dependencies**:
   - Ensure you have the `python-louvain` library installed. Install it via `pip install python-louvain`.

### Notes:
- Replace the truncated edge list with the complete edge list from your input.
- The layout algorithm is deterministic in terms of community structure, but randomization can be added for fine-tuning if needed.
