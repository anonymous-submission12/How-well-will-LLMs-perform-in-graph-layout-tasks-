Below is a Python script that achieves the task of detecting communities in the graph using a modularity-based method (such as the Louvain algorithm), assigning nodes to their communities, and generating a custom graph layout. The layout assigns nodes in each community to positions that maintain the communities' compactness:

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import json
import math

def generate_layout(graph_data):
    # Create a graph from the edge list
    G = nx.Graph()
    G.add_edges_from(graph_data)
    
    # Perform community detection using Louvain method
    partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)
    
    # Group nodes by their community
    communities = {}
    for node, comm in partition.items():
        if comm not in communities:
            communities[comm] = []
        communities[comm].append(node)
    
    # Generate a custom layout
    positions = {}
    num_communities = len(communities)
    angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_communities
    radius = 10  # Distance of community centers from the origin
    intra_comm_radius = 3  # Radius within a community for its nodes

    for idx, (comm, nodes) in enumerate(communities.items()):
        # Calculate the center of this community
        angle = angle_step * idx
        comm_center_x = radius * math.cos(angle)
        comm_center_y = radius * math.sin(angle)
        
        # Assign positions for nodes in this community
        num_nodes = len(nodes)
        node_angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_nodes if num_nodes > 1 else 0
        
        for node_idx, node in enumerate(nodes):
            node_angle = node_idx * node_angle_step
            node_x = comm_center_x + intra_comm_radius * math.cos(node_angle)
            node_y = comm_center_y + intra_comm_radius * math.sin(node_angle)
            positions[node] = (node_x, node_y)
    
    # Return layout in JSON format
    return json.dumps(positions, indent=2)

# Input edge list
graph_data = [(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 11), (0, 12), (0, 14), (0, 22), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 15), ...]  # Truncated for brevity; replace with full data

# Generate layout
layout = generate_layout(graph_data)

# Print the JSON layout
print(layout)
```

### Key Points of the Code:
1. **Community Detection:** The Louvain algorithm (`community_louvain.best_partition`) is used to divide the graph into communities.
2. **Custom Layout Generation:**
   - Communities are arranged in a circular pattern around the origin.
   - Within each community, nodes are also arranged in a circular pattern around the community's center.
   - This arrangement ensures that communities remain visually distinct and the layout maintains clarity.
3. **JSON Output:** The final node positions are serialized into a JSON format.

### Dependencies:
Make sure to install the `python-louvain` package for community detection:
```bash
pip install python-louvain
```

### Notes:
- Replace the `graph_data` variable with your full edge list to use directly.
- The output is a JSON object where each node is mapped to its `(x, y)` position in the layout.
