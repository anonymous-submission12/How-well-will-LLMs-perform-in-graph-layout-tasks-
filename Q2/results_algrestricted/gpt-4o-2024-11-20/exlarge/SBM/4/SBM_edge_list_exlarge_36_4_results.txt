Here is a Python script that accomplishes the task using no existing layout algorithms, while leveraging community detection to preserve the graph's community structure. Instead of visually rendering the graph, the script calculates positions for each node and outputs the layout as JSON.

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain  # Louvain method for community detection
import json
import math

def generate_graph_layout(edge_list):
    # Step 1: Create a graph from the edge list
    graph = nx.Graph(edge_list)

    # Step 2: Detect communities using the Louvain method
    partition = community_louvain.best_partition(graph)

    # Step 3: Group nodes by community
    communities = {}
    for node, community in partition.items():
        if community not in communities:
            communities[community] = []
        communities[community].append(node)

    # Step 4: Assign positions for each community
    positions = {}
    num_communities = len(communities)
    angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_communities
    community_radius = 10  # Distance between communities

    for i, (community_id, nodes) in enumerate(communities.items()):
        # Calculate a central position for each community
        angle = i * angle_step
        community_center_x = community_radius * math.cos(angle)
        community_center_y = community_radius * math.sin(angle)

        # Distribute nodes within the community in a circular pattern
        num_nodes = len(nodes)
        node_angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_nodes
        node_radius = 3  # Radius for nodes within a community

        for j, node in enumerate(nodes):
            node_angle = j * node_angle_step
            node_x = community_center_x + node_radius * math.cos(node_angle)
            node_y = community_center_y + node_radius * math.sin(node_angle)
            positions[node] = (node_x, node_y)

    return positions

# Input edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 7), (0, 10), (1, 2), (1, 7), (1, 9), (1, 13), (1, 18), (1, 19), 
    (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 11), (2, 13), (2, 14), (2, 17), (2, 18),
    (2, 19), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 10), (3, 13), (3, 14), (3, 17), (3, 19), (4, 5),
    # ... shortened for brevity, include the remaining edges from the provided graph
]

# Step 5: Generate node positions
positions = generate_graph_layout(edge_list)

# Step 6: Output as JSON
layout_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Construction**: The graph is instantiated from the provided edge list using `networkx`.
2. **Community Detection**: The Louvain community detection algorithm is used to divide the graph into communities.
3. **Position Assignment**:
    - Communities are placed in a circular arrangement around the origin.
    - Nodes within each community are distributed in a smaller circular arrangement centered at the community's position.
4. **Layout Export**: Node positions are stored in a dictionary and exported as JSON.

Replace the `"shortened for brevity"` comment in the `edge_list` with the full edge list as provided in your input. The script avoids using visual libraries for rendering and focuses solely on generating node positions in JSON format.
