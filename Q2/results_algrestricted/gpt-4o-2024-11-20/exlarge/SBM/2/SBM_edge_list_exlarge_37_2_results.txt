Below is the Python script to manually generate a layout for the given graph. It uses a spring-like force approach to balance Euclidean and graph-theoretic distances. No external graph layout algorithms are used.

```python
import json
import random
from collections import defaultdict
from math import sqrt

def generate_graph_layout(edge_list, max_iter=1000, learning_rate=0.01):
    # Initialize node positions randomly in 2D space
    nodes = list(set([node for edge in edge_list for node in edge]))
    positions = {node: [random.uniform(-1, 1), random.uniform(-1, 1)] for node in nodes}

    # Calculate graph-theoretic distance using BFS
    def bfs_distances(start_node):
        distances = {start_node: 0}
        queue = [start_node]
        while queue:
            current = queue.pop(0)
            for neighbor in graph[current]:
                if neighbor not in distances:
                    distances[neighbor] = distances[current] + 1
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        return distances

    # Build adjacency list representation of the graph
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edge_list:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)

    # Compute pairwise graph-theoretic distances
    graph_distances = {}
    for node in nodes:
        graph_distances[node] = bfs_distances(node)

    # Spring-like force model to adjust positions
    for _ in range(max_iter):
        forces = {node: [0, 0] for node in nodes}
        for i in nodes:
            for j in nodes:
                if i != j:
                    # Desired Euclidean distance should correlate with graph-theoretic distance
                    graph_distance = graph_distances[i].get(j, float('inf'))
                    if graph_distance == float('inf'):
                        continue
                    target_dist = graph_distance
                    delta_x = positions[j][0] - positions[i][0]
                    delta_y = positions[j][1] - positions[i][1]
                    current_dist = sqrt(delta_x**2 + delta_y**2) + 1e-6  # To avoid division by zero
                    
                    # Force magnitude proportional to the difference between current and target distances
                    force_magnitude = (current_dist - target_dist) * learning_rate
                    force_x = (delta_x / current_dist) * force_magnitude
                    force_y = (delta_y / current_dist) * force_magnitude
                    
                    # Accumulate forces
                    forces[i][0] += force_x
                    forces[i][1] += force_y
        
        # Update positions based on forces
        for node in nodes:
            positions[node][0] -= forces[node][0]
            positions[node][1] -= forces[node][1]

    # Convert layout to JSON format
    layout = {node: {"x": positions[node][0], "y": positions[node][1]} for node in nodes}
    return json.dumps(layout, indent=2)

# Input edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 11), (0, 14), (0, 18), (0, 22), 
    # ... (truncated for brevity; use the full provided edge list)
    (73, 75), (74, 75)
]

# Generate layout and print JSON
graph_layout_json = generate_graph_layout(edge_list[:])  # Pass complete edge list
print(graph_layout_json)
```

### Key Features:
1. **Custom Spring Model**: The code calculates pairwise graph-theoretic distances with Breadth-First Search (BFS) and adjusts node positions iteratively.
2. **Force Application**: Forces are determined as proportional to the difference between current distances and desired graph-theoretic distances.
3. **JSON Output**: Layout is outputted as a JSON object with `x` and `y` coordinates for each node.
4. **No External Drawing**: The script stops at layout generation and JSON conversion without visualization.
