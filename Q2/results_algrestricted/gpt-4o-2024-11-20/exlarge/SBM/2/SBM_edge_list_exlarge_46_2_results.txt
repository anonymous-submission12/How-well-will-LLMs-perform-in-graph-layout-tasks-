Here is a Python script to compute a graph layout that ensures consistency between the Euclidean distance and the graph-theoretic distance (shortest path in the graph). The algorithm calculates node positions using a force-like placement technique, embedded with metric stress minimization. Finally, the script outputs the layout as a JSON object.

```python
import json
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix
from scipy.sparse.csgraph import shortest_path

def compute_layout(edge_list, iterations=500, dim=2, learning_rate=0.01):
    # Extract all nodes
    nodes = set()
    for u, v in edge_list:
        nodes.add(u)
        nodes.add(v)
    nodes = list(nodes)
    node_index = {node: i for i, node in enumerate(nodes)}
    num_nodes = len(nodes)

    # Create adjacency matrix
    adjacency_matrix = np.zeros((num_nodes, num_nodes))
    for u, v in edge_list:
        adjacency_matrix[node_index[u], node_index[v]] = 1
        adjacency_matrix[node_index[v], node_index[u]] = 1

    # Compute shortest path distances
    graph_distances = shortest_path(csr_matrix(adjacency_matrix), directed=False)

    # Initialize random positions for each node in a D-dimensional space
    positions = np.random.rand(num_nodes, dim)

    # Stress minimization-based layout optimization
    for _ in range(iterations):
        for i in range(num_nodes):
            for j in range(i + 1, num_nodes):
                if not np.isfinite(graph_distances[i, j]):
                    continue  # Skip if nodes are not connected via any path
                delta = positions[i] - positions[j]
                distance = np.linalg.norm(delta) + 1e-6  # Avoid division by zero
                desired_distance = graph_distances[i, j]
                force = (distance - desired_distance) / distance
                update = learning_rate * force * delta
                positions[i] -= update
                positions[j] += update

    # Scale positions to fit in a unit square (optional)
    min_pos = positions.min(axis=0)
    max_pos = positions.max(axis=0)
    positions = (positions - min_pos) / (max_pos - min_pos)

    # Generate layout as a JSON object
    layout = {nodes[i]: positions[i].tolist() for i in range(num_nodes)}
    return json.dumps(layout, indent=2)

# Input graph edge_list
edge_list = [
    (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 12), (0, 13), (0, 16), (0, 17), (0, 20), (0, 31), (0, 36),
    (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 10), (1, 14), (1, 16), (1, 18), (1, 21), (1, 23), (1, 24), (1, 25), (1, 49),
    (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 8), (2, 10), (2, 12), (2, 14), (2, 16), (2, 17), (2, 18), (2, 19), (2, 21),
    # [Include all other given edges from above for brevity...]
    (73, 74), (73, 75)
]

# Compute and print graph layout
layout_json = compute_layout(edge_list)
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Graph Initialization**: The adjacency matrix is created, and graph-theoretic distances are computed using the `shortest_path` function from SciPy.

2. **Random Initialization**: Nodes are assigned random starting positions in a 2D space.

3. **Stress Minimization**: The algorithm iteratively updates node positions to minimize the difference between Euclidean distances in 2D space and graph-theoretic distances.

4. **Normalization**: Positions are scaled to fit in a unit square for consistency.

5. **Output**: The final layout is returned as a JSON string, where each node is associated with its 2D coordinates.

### Notes:
- You can modify the `iterations` and `learning_rate` parameters to better suit the size and complexity of your graph.
- The graph layout algorithm is implemented from scratch, and no external layout algorithms or visualization libraries are used, adhering to your constraints.
