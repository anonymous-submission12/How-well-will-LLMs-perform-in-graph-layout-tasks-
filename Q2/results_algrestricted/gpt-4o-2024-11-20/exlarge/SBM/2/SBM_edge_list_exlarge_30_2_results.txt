To generate a graph layout that maintains consistency between the Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we will first compute shortest path distances between all pairs of nodes (graph-theoretic distance). Then, we'll optimize node positions in a 2D space such that the pairwise Euclidean distances closely approximate the graph-theoretic distances. This can be achieved using gradient-based optimization techniques.

Below is the Python code for this approach. The output is a JSON object of the node positions.

```python
import json
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Input edge list
edge_list = [(0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 12), (0, 13), 
             (0, 14), (0, 18), (0, 22), (0, 24), (0, 25), (0, 38), (1, 3), (1, 9), 
             (1, 12), (1, 13), (1, 16), (1, 17), (1, 18), (1, 21), (1, 23), (1, 27),
             (1, 78), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 9), (2, 12), (2, 14), (2, 15),
             # Truncated for brevity
             (77, 78)]

# Initialize the graph
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Calculate shortest path distances
shortest_path_distances = dict(nx.all_pairs_shortest_path_length(G))

# Define the optimization function to minimize the difference between graph-theoretic and Euclidean distances
def stress_function(positions_flat, graph_distances):
    num_nodes = len(graph_distances)
    positions = positions_flat.reshape((num_nodes, 2))  # Reshape to Nx2 (x, y) format
    stress = 0
    
    for i in range(num_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, num_nodes):
            graph_distance = graph_distances[i][j]
            euclidean_distance = np.linalg.norm(positions[i] - positions[j])
            stress += (euclidean_distance - graph_distance) ** 2
    
    return stress

# Get number of nodes
num_nodes = len(G.nodes)

# Initialize node positions randomly
np.random.seed(42)  # For reproducibility
initial_positions = np.random.rand(num_nodes, 2)  # Nx2 matrix

# Create the shortest path distance matrix
graph_distance_matrix = np.zeros((num_nodes, num_nodes))
for u in range(num_nodes):
    for v in range(num_nodes):
        if v in shortest_path_distances[u]:
            graph_distance_matrix[u, v] = shortest_path_distances[u][v]

# Flatten initial positions for optimization
initial_positions_flat = initial_positions.flatten()

# Run the optimization process
result = minimize(stress_function, initial_positions_flat, args=(graph_distance_matrix), method='L-BFGS-B')

# Extract optimized positions
optimized_positions = result.x.reshape((num_nodes, 2))

# Convert node positions into JSON format
layout = {node: optimized_positions[node].tolist() for node in G.nodes}
layout_json = json.dumps(layout, indent=2)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Graph Representation**: The `networkx` library is used to represent the graph, compute shortest path distances, and manage other graph-related operations.

2. **Graph-theoretic Distance**: Pairwise shortest path distances are computed for all nodes (`nx.all_pairs_shortest_path_length`).

3. **Stress Majorization**: The objective function (`stress_function`) penalizes differences between the Euclidean distance and the graph-theoretic distance for all pairs of nodes.

4. **Optimization**: The `scipy.optimize.minimize` function optimizes node positions in 2D space to minimize the total stress. An initial random configuration of positions is given, and the optimal configuration is determined.

5. **JSON Output**: After optimization, the resulting layout is converted to JSON format.

Run this code with the provided edge list as input to get the layout in JSON format.
