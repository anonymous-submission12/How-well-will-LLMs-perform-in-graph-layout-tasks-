Below is the Python script that generates a layout for the given graph while attempting to minimize edge crossings. The layout is returned as a JSON object containing the positions of the nodes. The approach utilizes a basic iterative force-directed algorithm without relying on existing layout algorithms provided by libraries like NetworkX.

```python
import json
import random
import math

# Function to compute a basic force-directed layout
def generate_layout(edges, iterations=1000, width=1000, height=1000):
    # Initialize positions of nodes randomly in the given area
    nodes = set()
    for edge in edges:
        nodes.update(edge)
    positions = {node: [random.uniform(0, width), random.uniform(0, height)] for node in nodes}
    
    # Constants for the force-directed layout
    k = math.sqrt(width * height / len(nodes))  # Optimal distance between nodes
    C_repulsion = 1  # Repulsion constant
    C_attraction = 1  # Attraction constant
    damping = 0.85  # Damping factor for velocity

    # Initialize velocities
    velocities = {node: [0, 0] for node in nodes}

    for _ in range(iterations):
        # Calculate repulsive forces
        forces = {node: [0, 0] for node in nodes}
        for node1 in nodes:
            for node2 in nodes:
                if node1 != node2:
                    dx = positions[node1][0] - positions[node2][0]
                    dy = positions[node1][1] - positions[node2][1]
                    distance = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2) + 1e-6  # Avoid division by zero
                    force = C_repulsion * k**2 / distance**2
                    forces[node1][0] += force * (dx / distance)
                    forces[node1][1] += force * (dy / distance)

        # Calculate attractive forces
        for edge in edges:
            node1, node2 = edge
            dx = positions[node1][0] - positions[node2][0]
            dy = positions[node1][1] - positions[node2][1]
            distance = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2) + 1e-6  # Avoid division by zero
            force = C_attraction * (distance**2) / k
            forces[node1][0] -= force * (dx / distance)
            forces[node1][1] -= force * (dy / distance)
            forces[node2][0] += force * (dx / distance)
            forces[node2][1] += force * (dy / distance)

        # Update velocities and positions
        for node in nodes:
            velocities[node][0] = damping * (velocities[node][0] + forces[node][0])
            velocities[node][1] = damping * (velocities[node][1] + forces[node][1])
            positions[node][0] += velocities[node][0]
            positions[node][1] += velocities[node][1]

            # Keep nodes within bounds
            positions[node][0] = max(0, min(width, positions[node][0]))
            positions[node][1] = max(0, min(height, positions[node][1]))

    return positions

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Nodes are assigned random positions in a bounded space (`width` x `height`).
   - Velocities for each node are initialized to zero.

2. **Force Calculation**:
   - **Repulsive Forces**: Nodes repel each other to maintain a minimum distance based on an optimal distance `k`.
   - **Attractive Forces**: Edge connections pull nodes closer based on their distance.

3. **Position Update**:
   - Forces are translated into velocities, which are applied to update node positions.
   - Nodes are restricted to remain within the bounds of the defined area.

4. **Output**:
   - The final layout, containing the positions of the nodes, is serialized into JSON format for output.

5. **Randomness**:
   - Random initialization may lead to slightly different layouts each time you run the script. For deterministic results, initialize the random seed (`random.seed()`).

Run the script to get the graph layout as a JSON object, which represents the x-y coordinates of the nodes.
