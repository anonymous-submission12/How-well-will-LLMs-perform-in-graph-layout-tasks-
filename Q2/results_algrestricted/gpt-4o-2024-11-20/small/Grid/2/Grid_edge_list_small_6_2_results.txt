Below is the Python code to create a graph layout that ensures consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, as specified. The layout will be calculated using a force-directed approach with constraints to preserve graph-theoretic distances:

```python
import json
import math
import random
from collections import defaultdict

# Input: Edge list representation of the graph
edges = [
    (0, 1), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 10), (3, 4), (3, 11),
    (4, 5), (4, 12), (5, 6), (5, 13), (6, 7), (6, 14), (7, 15), (8, 9),
    (8, 16), (9, 10), (9, 17), (10, 11), (10, 18), (11, 12), (11, 19),
    (12, 13), (12, 20), (13, 14), (13, 21), (14, 15), (14, 22), (15, 23),
    (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23)
]

# Step 1: Build the adjacency list for BFS traversal
graph = defaultdict(list)
for u, v in edges:
    graph[u].append(v)
    graph[v].append(u)

# Helper function to compute graph-theoretic distances using BFS
def bfs_distances(graph, start_node):
    distances = {start_node: 0}
    queue = [start_node]
    while queue:
        current = queue.pop(0)
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            if neighbor not in distances:
                distances[neighbor] = distances[current] + 1
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return distances

# Step 2: Initialize layout with random positions
positions = {node: (random.uniform(0, 1), random.uniform(0, 1)) for node in graph}

# Step 3: Force-directed algorithm to adjust positions
def adjust_positions(graph, positions, max_iter=1000, learning_rate=0.01, target_dist=1.0):
    for _ in range(max_iter):
        displacement = {node: [0.0, 0.0] for node in graph}
        for node in graph:
            theoretical_distances = bfs_distances(graph, node)
            for other_node in graph:
                if node == other_node:
                    continue
                # Calculate Euclidean distance
                x1, y1 = positions[node]
                x2, y2 = positions[other_node]
                euclidean_dist = math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)
                
                # Target distance from graph-theoretic distance
                graph_dist = theoretical_distances[other_node]
                target = graph_dist * target_dist
                
                # Apply a spring-like force
                force = (euclidean_dist - target) * 0.1  # Spring constant = 0.1
                if euclidean_dist > 0:
                    dx = (x2 - x1) / euclidean_dist * force
                    dy = (y2 - y1) / euclidean_dist * force
                else:
                    dx, dy = 0, 0
                
                displacement[node][0] += dx
                displacement[node][1] += dy
        
        # Update positions
        for node in positions:
            positions[node] = (
                positions[node][0] + learning_rate * displacement[node][0],
                positions[node][1] + learning_rate * displacement[node][1]
            )
    return positions

# Execute force-directed layout adjustment
final_positions = adjust_positions(graph, positions)

# Convert positions to JSON format
