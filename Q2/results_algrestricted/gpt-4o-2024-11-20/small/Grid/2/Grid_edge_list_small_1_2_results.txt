Here is the Python script for generating the layout of the graph provided, given in a consistent manner that adheres to the rule of maintaining consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance. The output is returned as a JSON object.

```python
import json

def calculate_layout(edge_list):
    # Create adjacency list
    adjacency_list = {}
    for edge in edge_list:
        u, v = edge

        if v not in adjacency_list:
            adjacency_list[v] = []
        adjacency_list[u].append(v)
        adjacency_list[v].append(u)

        visited = set(queue)

        while queue:

            current_distance = distances[current]

                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    distances[neighbor] = current_distance + 1

    positions = {}
    radius_step = 5   # Fixed step in radius for nodes farther away
    angle_step = math.pi / 6  # Fixed angle step for nodes in the same "ring" of distance

# Generate layout
layout = calculate_layout(edge_list)

```

This script calculates a consistent graph layout using a custom radial approach. Nodes farther away from the starting node (node `0`) will form "rings" at increasing radii, and nodes in each "ring" will be equally spaced based on angles. The output is presented in JSON format with the coordinates of each node (`x` and `y`).
