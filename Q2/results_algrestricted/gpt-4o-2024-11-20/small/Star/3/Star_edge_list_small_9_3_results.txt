Here is the required Python script that generates the layout for the graph you provided. This script calculates the positions manually, aiming to evenly spread the nodes based on the structure of the graph to minimize edge crossings. The positions are returned in JSON format.

```python
import json

def generate_layout(edge_list):
    """
    Manually compute a layout for the graph to minimize edge crossings.
    """
    # Identify all the nodes in the graph
    nodes = set()
    for u, v in edge_list:
        nodes.add(u)
        nodes.add(v)
    nodes = list(nodes)
    
    # Assign positions manually
    layout = {}
    center_node = 0  # This is the central node connecting to all others in your edge list.
    radius = 10  # The radius of the circular layout for leaf nodes

    layout[center_node] = (0, 0)  # Place the central node at the origin

    # Place other nodes evenly spaced in a circular pattern around the center node
    leaf_nodes = [node for node in nodes if node != center_node]
    angle_increment = 360 / len(leaf_nodes)  # Divide full circle by number of leaf nodes
    
    for i, node in enumerate(leaf_nodes):
        angle_deg = i * angle_increment
        angle_rad = angle_deg * (3.141592653589793 / 180)  # Convert degrees to radians
        x = radius * (2*0
