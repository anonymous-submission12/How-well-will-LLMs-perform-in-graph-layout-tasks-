Here is the Python script to generate a layout for the provided graph. This code calculates positions for the graph nodes such that it minimizes edge crossings by manually implementing a basic strategy for node placement. Note that it does not rely on any existing graph layout algorithms.

```python
import json

def generate_layout(edge_list):
    # Extract all nodes from the edge list
    nodes = set()
    for edge in edge_list:
        nodes.update(edge)
    nodes = list(nodes)

    # Initialize a dictionary to store positions for each node
    positions = {}

    # Place the central node (the "hub" node)
    center_node = 0
    positions[center_node] = (0, 0)

    # Determine positions for other nodes
    num_spokes = len(nodes) - 1  # nodes excluding the center
    angle_increment = 360 / num_spokes

    # Place the "spoke" nodes in a circular arrangement around the center
    radius = 10
    angle = 0
    for node in nodes:
        if node == center_node:
            continue
        # Convert angle to radians for coordinate calculation
        radians = angle * (3.14159 / 180)
        x = radius * np.cos(radians)
        y = radius * np.sin(radians)
        positions[node] = (x, y)
        angle += angle_increment

    # Convert layout dictionary to JSON format
    layout_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)

    return layout_json

# Required for math functions
import numpy as np

# Define edge list input
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8),
    (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 12), (0, 13), (0, 14), (0, 15), 
    (0, 16), (0, 17), (0, 18), (0, 19), (0, 20), (0, 21), (0, 22), 
    (0, 23), (0, 24)
]

# Generate layout
layout_json = generate_layout(edge_list)

# Output the layout
print(layout_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Central Node Placement**: Node `0` is placed at the center `(0, 0)`.
2. **Circular Spoke Layout**: All other nodes (`1..24`) are placed equidistantly on a circle around the center. The angle between consecutive nodes ensures a uniform distribution.
3. **Edge Crossings Management**: Since this graph is a star topology, the layout inherently minimizes edge crossings by placing all peripheral nodes around a central node.

The final graph layout is output in a JSON format, with each node's position as a tuple `(x, y)`. It does not include any use of visualization libraries for rendering.
