Here's the Python code designed to generate a consistent layout for the graph. The layout maintains consistency between Euclidean distance (in 2D space) and graph-theoretic (shortest path) distance. The code calculates positions systematically rather than relying on pre-built algorithms.

```python
import json
import math

def calculate_graph_layout(edge_list):
    # Step 1: Build adjacency list to represent the graph
    adjacency_list = {}
    for u, v in edge_list:
        if u not in adjacency_list:
            adjacency_list[u] = []
        if v not in adjacency_list:
            adjacency_list[v] = []
        adjacency_list[u].append(v)
        adjacency_list[v].append(u)
    
    # Step 2: Breadth-First Search (BFS) to assign shortest path distances from node 0
    distances = {}
    visited = set()
    queue = [(0, 0)]  # (current_node, current_distance_from_start)
    
    while queue:
        node, dist = queue.pop(0)
        if node in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(node)
        distances[node] = dist
        for neighbor in adjacency_list[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
    
    # Step 3: Generate a graph layout based on shortest path distances
    positions = {}
    for node, distance in distances.items():
        # Assign positions in a spiral manner based on distance
        angle = distance * (math.pi / 4)  # Spread nodes evenly
        radius = distance  # Use distance as radius to ensure consistency
        x = radius * math.cos(angle)
        y = radius * math.sin(angle)
        positions[node] = {"x": x, "y": y}
    
    return positions


# Input: Graph edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), 
             (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), 
             (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23)]

# Generate the layout
layout = calculate_graph_layout(edge_list)

# Output the layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Representation**: The adjacency list helps represent the graph directly from the edge list.
2. **Shortest Path Calculation**: BFS determines the minimum hop distance (graph-theoretic distance) from node 0 to all other nodes.
3. **Position Assignment**: Nodes are placed in polar coordinates â€” radius corresponds to distance, and angle increases with distance to distribute nodes in a visually proportional manner.
4. **Output**: Positions are generated using Euclidean coordinates (x, y) and are returned in JSON format.

Feel free to further customize the layout logic or integrate additional constraints as needed!
