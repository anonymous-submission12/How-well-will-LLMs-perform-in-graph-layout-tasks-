Below is the Python script that processes the edge list and generates a layout. The code assigns positions to nodes such that nodes' Euclidean distances correspond to their graph-theoretic distances, visually resembling a straight line.

```python
import json

def generate_graph_layout(edge_list):
    # Create a dictionary to record positions
    positions = {}
    
    # Assign nodes positions based on their graph-theoretic distance from the starting node (node 0)
    current_position = 0
    
    for edge in edge_list:
        node_a, node_b = edge
        
        # If node_a is not positioned, assign it
        if node_a not in positions:
            positions[node_a] = current_position
        # Increment the position for node_b relative to node_a
        positions[node_b] = (positions[node_a]+!!
