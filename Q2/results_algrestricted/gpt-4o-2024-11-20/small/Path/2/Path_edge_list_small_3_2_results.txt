Here is the Python script you can use to compute a graph layout that ensures consistency between the Euclidean distance and the graph-theoretic distance. The layout generated will aim to achieve this by embedding the graph in a 2D space while maintaining the proper proportionality between distances.

```python
import json
import math

def generate_graph_layout(edge_list):
    # Step 1: Compute graph-theoretic distances (shortest paths)
    def bfs_shortest_distances(node_count, edges, start_node):
        distances = {i: float('inf') for i in range(node_count)}
        distances[start_node] = 0
        queue = [start_node]
        while queue:
            current = queue.pop(0)
            current_distance = distances[current]
            for u, v in edges:
                neighbor = v if current == u else u if current == v else None
                if neighbor is not None and distances[neighbor] == float('inf'):
                    distances[neighbor] = current_distance + 1
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        return distances

    nodes = set()
    for u, v in edge_list:
        nodes.add(u)
        nodes.add(v)
    node_count = len(nodes)

    all_distances = {}
    for node in nodes:
        all_distances[node] = bfs_shortest_distances(node_count, edge_list, node)

    # Step 2: Map nodes to 2D space using a scaling approach for dimensions
    positions = {i: [0, 0] for i in nodes}
    used = set()
    scaling_factor = 50  # Scaling factor adjusts graph size
    placed_nodes = []

    for layer_offset, current in enumerate(sorted(nodes)):
        angle_rads=layer_offset*math.pi
        positions[current] [0]=  layer_offset+scaling_factor
