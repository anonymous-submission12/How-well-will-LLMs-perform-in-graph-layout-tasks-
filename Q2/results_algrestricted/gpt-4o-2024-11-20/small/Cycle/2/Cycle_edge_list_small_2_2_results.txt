To generate a layout for the graph while maintaining consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we can use a custom algorithm. The algorithm will calculate positions for each node based on their shortest path distances from a reference node. Here's the Python script:

```python
import json
import math
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def calculate_shortest_path_distances(edge_list, start_node):
    """Calculate shortest path distances from the start_node to all other nodes."""
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edge_list:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
    
    distances = {start_node: 0}
    queue = deque([start_node])
    
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            if neighbor not in distances:
                distances[neighbor] = distances[current] + 1
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return distances

def generate_graph_layout(edge_list):
    """Generate a graph layout based on shortest path distances."""
    # Step 1: Calculate shortest path distances from an arbitrary start node (e.g., node 0)
    start_node = 0
    distances = calculate_shortest_path_distances(edge_list, start_node)
    
    # Step 2: Assign positions based on distances
    positions = {}
    angle_step = 2 * math.pi / len(distances)  # Spread nodes in a circular layout
    for node, distance in distances.items():
        angle = node * angle_step
        radius = distance  # Use graph-theoretic distance as radius
        x = radius * math.cos(angle)
        y = radius * math.sin(angle)
        positions[node] = {"x": x, "y": y}
    
    return positions

# Input graph data
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 21), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21)]

# Generate layout
layout = generate_graph_layout(edge_list)

# Output layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=4))
```

This script calculates the shortest path distances from a reference node (node 0) and assigns positions to nodes based on these distances. The nodes are spread in a circular layout, with the radius proportional to the graph-theoretic distance. The final output is a JSON representation of the layout.
