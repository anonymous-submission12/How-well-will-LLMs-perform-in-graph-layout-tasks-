Below is a Python script that computes the layout of the graph based on preserving consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance. By default, it uses a custom force-directed mechanism without relying on existing built-in graph layout algorithms.

The final positions of the nodes will be outputted in JSON format.

```python
import json
import math
from collections import defaultdict

# Graph edge list
edges = [(0, 1), (0, 28), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), 
         (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), 
         (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26), (26, 27), (27, 28)]

# Graph adjacency list
graph = defaultdict(list)
for u, v in edges:
    graph[u].append(v)
    graph[v].append(u)

# Function to calculate graph-theoretic distances using BFS
def calculate_distances(graph, start_node):
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    distances[start_node] = 0
    queue = [start_node]
    while queue:
        current = queue.pop(0)
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            if distances[neighbor] == float('inf'):
                distances[neighbor] = distances[current] + 1
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return distances

# Custom layout generation algorithm

    # Initialize random positions for nodes
    positions = {node: (math.cos(node), math.sin(node)) for node in graph}  # Circular initial positions
    
    # Calculate all-pairs shortest paths
    all_distances = {node: calculate_distances(graph, node) for node in graph}
    
    # Ensure consistent layout via force-directed adjustments
    for _ in range(iterations):
        # Initialize force accumulators
        displacement = {node: [0, 0] for node in graph}
        
        # Compute forces between all pairs of nodes
        for u in graph:
            for v in graph:
                if u != v:
                    # Desired distance proportional to graph-theoretic shortest path
                    desired_distance = all_distances[u][v]
                    
                    # Current Euclidean distance
                    ux, uy = positions[u]
                    vx, vy = positions[v]
                    dx, dy = vx - ux, vy - uy
                    euclidean_distance = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2) + 1e-9  # Add a small value to avoid division by zero
                    
                    # Force calculation
                    force = (euclidean_distance - desired_distance) / euclidean_distance
                    displacement[u][0] += force * dx
                    displacement[u][1] += force * dy
        
        # Update positions based on forces
        for node in positions:
            positions[node] = (
                positions[node][0] + lr * displacement[node][0],
                positions[node][1] + lr * displacement[node][1]
            )
    
    return positions

# Generate graph layout
layout = generate_layout(graph)

# Convert layout to JSON format
layout_json = {node: {'x': pos[0], 'y': pos[1]} for node, pos in layout.items()}

```

### Key Points of the Code:
1. **Input Graph Representation**: The script uses an adjacency list to represent the graph and takes the edge list as input.

2. **Shortest Path Calculation**: Graph-theoretic distances are computed using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

3. **Custom Layout Algorithm**:
   - Initial positions of nodes are assigned in a circular manner.
   - A force-directed principle is implemented where forces are proportional to the difference between graph-theoretic and Euclidean distances.

4. **Output**: The node positions are output in JSON format after convergence (or a set number of iterations).
