Below is the Python code to generate a graph layout using a method that attempts to maintain consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance. To achieve this, a multidimensional scaling (MDS)-inspired approach is used without relying on any existing graph layout algorithms.

```python
import numpy as np
import json

def calculate_shortest_path_lengths(edges, num_nodes):
    """Calculate shortest path lengths using Floyd-Warshall Algorithm."""
    # Initialize distance matrix
    dist = np.full((num_nodes, num_nodes), np.inf)
    np.fill_diagonal(dist, 0)

    # Fill edge distances
    for u, v in edges:
        dist[u, v] = 1
        dist[v, u] = 1
    
    # Apply Floyd-Warshall to compute all-pairs shortest paths
    for k in range(num_nodes):
        for i in range(num_nodes):
            for j in range(num_nodes):
                dist[i, j] = min(dist[i, j], dist[i, k] + dist[k, j])
    
    return dist

def generate_layout(edges, num_nodes, dim=2):
    """Generate graph layout maintaining consistency between graph distance and Euclidean distance."""
    # Step 1: Compute shortest path distances between all node pairs
    shortest_path_dists = calculate_shortest_path_lengths(edges, num_nodes)
    
    # Step 2: Double centering for classical MDS
    squared_dists = shortest_path_dists ** 2
    mean_row = np.mean(squared_dists, axis=1)
    mean_col = np.mean(squared_dists, axis=0)
    grand_mean = np.mean(squared_dists)
    
    # Create the centering matrix
    B = -0.5 * (squared_dists - mean_row[:, np.newaxis] - mean_col[np.newaxis, :] + grand_mean)

    # Step 3: Compute the largest `dim` eigenvalues and eigenvectors
    eigvals, eigvecs = np.linalg.eigh(B)
    sorted_indices = np.argsort(eigvals)[::-1]  # Sort eigenvalues in descending order
    eigvals = eigvals[sorted_indices]
    eigvecs = eigvecs[:, sorted_indices]
    
    # Filter out negative eigenvalues (numerical inaccuracies might produce small negatives)
    positive_eigvals = np.maximum(eigvals[:dim], 0)
    coords = eigvecs[:, :dim] * np.sqrt(positive_eigvals)
    
    # Step 4: Generate positions mapping
    positions = {i: coords[i].tolist() for i in range(num_nodes)}
    return positions

# Input edge list and number of nodes
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 25), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), 
             (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), 
             (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25)]
num_nodes = 26

# Generate layout
layout = generate_layout(edge_list, num_nodes)

# Output layout as JSON
print(json.dumps(layout, indent=2))
```

### Explanation:

1. **Shortest Path Calculation**:
   - The `calculate_shortest_path_lengths` function computes the graph-theoretic shortest path between all pairs of nodes using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.

2. **MDS-inspired Approach**:
   - After computing the shortest path distance matrix, classical multidimensional scaling (MDS) is applied. The matrix `B` is constructed via double centering of the squared distances.
   - Eigen decomposition is then performed on `B` to obtain the `dim` (here, 2) largest eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues.
   - The resulting eigenvectors are scaled by the square root of their eigenvalues to produce 2D coordinates for each node.

3. **Normalization**:
   - Positive eigenvalues are enforced to account for numerical inaccuracies when computing eigen decomposition of `B`.

4. **Output**:
   - The final node positions are collected in a dictionary indexed by the node index and converted into JSON format.

Run the code to get the graph layout in JSON format. This layout ensures that the Euclidean distances are as consistent with the graph-theoretic distances as possible.
