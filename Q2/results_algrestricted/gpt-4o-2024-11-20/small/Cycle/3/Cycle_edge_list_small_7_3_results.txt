Below is a Python script that determines a layout for the given graph. The objective is to minimize edge crossings using a custom algorithm rather than relying on existing layout functions. Vertices in the graph are distributed linearly with slight deviations (based on adjacency), and the resulting layout is exported in JSON format.

```python
import json

def generate_layout(edge_list):
    # Create a dictionary to store the position of nodes
    positions = {}

    # Determine the number of nodes in the graph based on the edge_list
    nodes = set()
    for edge in edge_list:
        nodes.update(edge)
    nodes = sorted(nodes)
    
    # Initialize positions with linear arrangement along x-axis
    position_scale_factor = 100  # Spread nodes uniformly for visibility
    for i, node in enumerate(nodes):
        positions[node] = [i * position_scale_factor, 0]

    # Adjust positions of nodes to minimize edge crossings
    # This is a custom algorithm that tries to adjust based on adjacency.

    for u, v in edge_list:
        pos_u = positions[u]
        pos_v = positions[v]
        
        # Shift vertically to avoid potential crossings
        # This simplistic adjustment prioritizes neighboring connections
        if abs(pos_u[0] - pos_v[0]) < position_scale_factor:
            middle_x = (pos_u[0] + pos_v[0]) / 2
            positions[u] = [pos_u[0], pos_u[1] - position_scale_factor / 2]
            positions[v] = [middle_x, pos_v[1] + position_scale_factor / 2]

    return positions


# Input edge list for the provided graph
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 26), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5),
    (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11),
    (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16),
    (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21),
    (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (24, 25), (25, 26)
]

# Generate layout
layout = generate_layout(edge_list)

# Output the layout in JSON format
layout_json = json.dumps(layout, indent=4)
print(layout_json)
```

### Notes:
1. The node positions are initialized in a linear arrangement along the x-axis.
2. A simple vertical adjustment is performed for connected nodes, essentially to minimize crossings. While this suboptimal method works for small, simple graphs, it may require refinements for complex graphs.
3. The script outputs the positions as a JSON object. You can save this JSON or use it for further processing.
