Below is the Python script to generate a layout for the given graph. The layout ensures consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance. The script uses a custom force-directed algorithm to compute the positions of the nodes.

```python
import json
import math
import random
from collections import defaultdict

# Input graph as edge list
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 9), (0, 10), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 10), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), (3, 18), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 6), (5, 9), (5, 10), (6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 20), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (8, 9), (8, 10), (9, 20), (11, 12), (11, 13), (11, 14), (11, 17), (11, 18), (11, 19), (11, 20), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 18), (12, 19), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 17), (13, 19), (13, 20), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (14, 20), (15, 16), (15, 18), (15, 19), (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 19), (16, 20), (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 20), (18, 19), (18, 20), (19, 20)]

# Build adjacency list

for u, v in edge_list:
    graph[u].append(v)
    graph[v].append(u)

# Initialize positions randomly

# Parameters for the force-directed algorithm

# Helper function to compute Euclidean distance
def euclidean_distance(pos1, pos2):
    return math.sqrt((pos1[0] - pos2[0])**2 + (pos1[1] - pos2[1])**2)

# Force-directed layout algorithm
for _ in range(num_iterations):
    # Initialize forces
    forces = {node: [0, 0] for node in graph}
    
    # Compute repulsive forces
    for node1 in graph:
        for node2 in graph:
            if node1 != node2:
                pos1, pos2 = positions[node1], positions[node2]
                dist = euclidean_distance(pos1, pos2)
                if dist > 0:
                    repulsive_force = repulsion_constant / dist**2
                    forces[node1][0] += repulsive_force * (pos1[0] - pos2[0]) / dist
                    forces[node1][1] += repulsive_force * (pos1[1] - pos2[1]) / dist
    
    # Compute attractive forces
    for node1 in graph:
        for node2 in graph[node1]:
            pos1, pos2 = positions[node1], positions[node2]
            dist = euclidean_distance(pos1, pos2)
            attractive_force = attraction_constant * (dist**2)
            forces[node1][0] -= attractive_force * (pos1[0] - pos2[0]) / dist
            forces[node1][1] -= attractive_force * (pos1[1] - pos2[1]) / dist
    
    # Update positions based on forces
    for node in graph:
        positions[node] = (
            positions[node][0] + learning_rate * forces[node][0],
            positions[node][1] + learning_rate * forces[node][1]
        )

# Output the final layout in JSON format

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented as an adjacency list for efficient traversal.
2. **Random Initialization**: Node positions are initialized randomly in a 2D space.
3. **Force-Directed Algorithm**:
   - **Repulsive Forces**: Nodes repel each other based on the inverse square of their distance.
   - **Attractive Forces**: Connected nodes attract each other based on the square of their distance.
4. **Position Updates**: Node positions are updated iteratively based on the computed forces.
5. **Output**: The final layout is output in JSON format, where each node has `x` and `y` coordinates.

This script avoids using any existing graph layout algorithms and provides a custom implementation.
