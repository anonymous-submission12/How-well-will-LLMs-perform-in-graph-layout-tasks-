Here is the Python script to generate a layout for the provided graph. The layout is determined by attempting to optimize positions to maintain consistency between the Euclidean distance (physical proximity) and graph-theoretic distance (shortest path on the graph).

```python
import json
import math
import random
from collections import defaultdict
import itertools

def compute_shortest_paths(edges, num_nodes):
    # Use Floyd-Warshall Algorithm to compute shortest paths
    INF = float('inf')
    dist = [[INF] * num_nodes for _ in range(num_nodes)]
    for i in range(num_nodes):
        dist[i][i] = 0
    for u, v in edges:
        dist[u][v] = 1
        dist[v][u] = 1
    for k in range(num_nodes):
        for i in range(num_nodes):
            for j in range(num_nodes):
                if dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j]:
                    dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
    return dist

def stress_majorization(edges, num_nodes, iterations=1000, learning_rate=0.01):
    # Initialize positions randomly
    positions = {i: [random.uniform(0, 1), random.uniform(0, 1)] for i in range(num_nodes)}
    shortest_paths = compute_shortest_paths(edges, num_nodes)

    for _ in range(iterations):
        forces = defaultdict(lambda: [0, 0])
        for i, j in itertools.combinations(range(num_nodes), 2):
            if shortest_paths[i][j] < float('inf'):  # Nodes are connected
                # Desired Euclidean distance between the nodes
                desired_dist = shortest_paths[i][j]
                # Current distance in the layout
                dx = positions[j][0] - positions[i][0]
                dy = positions[j][1] - positions[i][1]
                current_dist = math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy)
                if current_dist == 0:
                    current_dist = 1e-4  # Avoid division by zero
                # Compute the force scaling factor
                force_mag = (current_dist - desired_dist) / current_dist
                forces[i][0] += force_mag * dx
                forces[i][1] += force_mag * dy
                forces[j][0] -= force_mag * dx
                forces[j][1] -= force_mag * dy

        # Update positions using the computed forces
        for i in range(num_nodes):
            positions[i][0] -= learning_rate * forces[i][0]
            positions[i][1] -= learning_rate * forces[i][1]

    return positions

def graph_layout_to_json(edges, num_nodes):
    positions = stress_majorization(edges, num_nodes)
    layout = {node: {"x": pos[0], "y": pos[1]} for node, pos in positions.items()}
    return json.dumps(layout, indent=4)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    edges = [(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 24), 
             (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 9), (4, 6), (5, 6), (7, 8), 
             (7, 9), (7, 11), (7, 12), (7, 13), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 13), 
             (8, 14), (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 12), (10, 11), (10, 12), (11, 12), 
             (11, 13), (11, 20), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 19), 
             (14, 20), (15, 18), (15, 19), (15, 20), (16, 17), (16, 19), 
             (16, 20), (17, 18), (17, 19), (18, 20), (21, 22), (21, 23), 
             (21, 24), (21, 26), (21, 27), (22, 25), (22, 26), (22, 27), 
             (23, 24), (23, 25), (23, 26), (23, 27), (24, 25), (24, 26), 
             (24, 27), (25, 27), (26, 27)]
    num_nodes = 28
    layout_json = graph_layout_to_json(edges, num_nodes)
    print(layout_json)
```

After running this script, the output will contain the graph layout in JSON format, where each node has calculated `x` and `y` coordinates that attempt to maintain consistency between the Euclidean distances of the layout and graph-theoretic distances.
