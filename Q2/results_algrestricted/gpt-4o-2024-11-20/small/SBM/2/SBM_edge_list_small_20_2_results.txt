Below is a Python script to generate a layout for the provided graph, ensuring the consistency between Euclidean distance and the graph-theoretic distance, without using existing graph layout functions. The layout coordinates for the graph nodes are then exported into a JSON format.

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is stored as an adjacency list using `defaultdict`.

2. **Computing Graph-Theoretic Distances**:
   - For each node, BFS is used to compute the shortest path distances to all other nodes.

3. **Stress Function**:
   - The stress function measures the difference between graph-theoretic distances and Euclidean distances in the 2D layout. It is minimized to achieve consistent distances.

4. **Optimization**:
   - Scipy's `minimize` is used with the L-BFGS-B method to solve the nonlinear optimization problem. Random initial positions are used as starting points.

5. **Output**:
   - The final layout is converted into a JSON format, mapping node IDs to their 2D coordinates.

This script does not involve visualization but produces coordinate positions in JSON format. You can use these positions to visualize the graph using any plotting library if needed separately.
