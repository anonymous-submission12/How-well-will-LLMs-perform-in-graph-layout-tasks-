Below is the Python code to compute a layout for the given graph. The positions are computed while maintaining consistency between the graph-theoretic distances (shortest path lengths) and Euclidean distances. The output of the script will be the graph layout in JSON format.

```python
import json
import math
from collections import defaultdict
from itertools import combinations
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def generate_graph_layout(edge_list):
    # Step 1: Build adjacency list and calculate shortest paths (graph-theoretic distances)
    def compute_shortest_paths(edges):
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)
        nodes = sorted(graph.keys())

        # Perform Floyd-Warshall algorithm for shortest paths
        shortest_paths = {node: {n: float('inf') for n in nodes} for node in nodes}
        for node in nodes:
            shortest_paths[node][node] = 0
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                shortest_paths[node][neighbor] = 1

        for k in nodes:
            for i in nodes:
                for j in nodes:
                    shortest_paths[i][j] = min(shortest_paths[i][j],
                                               shortest_paths[i][k] + shortest_paths[k][j])
        return shortest_paths, nodes

    shortest_paths, nodes = compute_shortest_paths(edge_list)

    # Step 2: Generate an initial random Euclidean layout
    num_nodes = len(nodes)
    initial_positions = np.random.rand(num_nodes, 2) * 10

    # Step 3: Define the stress function to minimize inconsistency
    def stress_function(positions):
        positions = positions.reshape((num_nodes, 2))
        stress = 0
        for i, j in combinations(range(num_nodes), 2):
            node_i, node_j = nodes[i], nodes[j]
            graph_dist = shortest_paths[node_i][node_j]
            if math.isfinite(graph_dist):  # Only consider reachable pairs
                euclidean_dist = np.linalg.norm(positions[i] - positions[j])
                stress += (euclidean_dist - graph_dist) ** 2
        return stress

    # Step 4: Minimize the stress function to assign consistent coordinates
    result = minimize(stress_function, initial_positions.flatten(), method='L-BFGS-B')
    final_positions = result.x.reshape((num_nodes, 2))

    # Step 5: Prepare and return layout in JSON format
    layout = {nodes[i]: final_positions[i].tolist() for i in range(num_nodes)}
    return json.dumps(layout, indent=4)

```

This script calculates a layout for the provided graph that minimizes stress, ensuring a strong relationship between Euclidean distances in the layout and graph-theoretic distances on the graph. The final layout is output as a JSON object.
