Below is the Python script that generates a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear. The script uses the `networkx` library for graph representation and the `community` module (Louvain algorithm) for community detection. The layout is generated manually by assigning positions to nodes based on their community membership.

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import json
import math

# Input graph data
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), 
    (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 22), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), 
    (5, 21), (7, 9), (7, 10), (7, 11), (7, 13), (8, 9), (8, 13), (8, 17), 
    (10, 12), (10, 13), (11, 12), (11, 13), (12, 13), (13, 18), (14, 15), 
    (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 20), (15, 17), (15, 20), (16, 17), 
    (16, 18), (16, 20), (17, 18), (17, 20), (18, 19), (18, 20), (18, 21), 
    (21, 22), (21, 25), (21, 26), (21, 27), (22, 23), (22, 24), (22, 25), 
    (22, 26), (22, 27), (23, 24), (23, 25), (23, 26), (24, 25), (24, 26), 
    (24, 27), (25, 26), (25, 27)
]

# Create a graph
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Detect communities using the Louvain algorithm
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Group nodes by community
communities = {}
for node, comm in partition.items():
    if comm not in communities:
        communities[comm] = []
    communities[comm].append(node)

# Generate positions for nodes
positions = {}
radius_step = 10  # Distance between communities
angle_step = math.pi / 4  # Angle step for nodes within a community
base_radius = 5  # Base radius for nodes within a community

for i, (comm, nodes) in enumerate(communities.items()):
    # Calculate the center of the community
    community_center_x = radius_step * math.cos(2 * math.pi * i / len(communities))
    community_center_y = radius_step * math.sin(2 * math.pi * i / len(communities))
    
    # Arrange nodes in a circular layout within the community
    for j, node in enumerate(nodes):
        angle = j * angle_step
        node_x = community_center_x + base_radius * math.cos(angle)
        node_y = community_center_y + base_radius * math.sin(angle)
        positions[node] = (node_x, node_y)

# Convert positions to JSON format
positions_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)

# Output the positions
print(positions_json)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Community Detection**:
   - The Louvain algorithm (`community_louvain.best_partition`) is used to detect communities in the graph. Each node is assigned to a community.

2. **Position Assignment**:
   - Communities are arranged in a circular layout, with each community's center placed at equal angular intervals around a larger circle.
   - Nodes within each community are arranged in a smaller circular layout around their community's center.

3. **Output**:
   - The final positions of nodes are stored in a dictionary and serialized to JSON format for output.

### Example Output:
The output will be a JSON object where each key is a node, and the value is a tuple representing the `(x, y)` position of the node. For example:
```json
{
    "0": [15.0, 0.0],
    "1": [14.0, 3.0],
    "2": [12.0, 5.0],
    ...
}
```
