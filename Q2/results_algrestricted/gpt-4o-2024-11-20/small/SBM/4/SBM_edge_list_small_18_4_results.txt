Here is the Python script that generates the layout for the provided graph, ensuring that the community structure is clear. The script uses a modularity-based community detection algorithm to divide communities, then places nodes within each community using custom positioning logic.

```python
import networkx as nx
import community  # community-louvain library for community detection
import json
import math

def generate_layout(edge_list):
    # Step 1: Create the graph
    G = nx.Graph()
    G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

    # Step 2: Detect communities using the Louvain method
    partition = community.best_partition(G)

    # Step 3: Group nodes by community
    communities = {}
    for node, comm in partition.items():
        if comm not in communities:
            communities[comm] = []
        communities[comm].append(node)

    # Step 4: Generate positions for nodes within each community
    positions = {}
    angle_step = math.pi * 2 / len(communities)
    community_center = {}
    center_radius = 10  # Distance of communities from the graph's center

    for i, (community_id, nodes) in enumerate(communities.items()):
        # Calculate circular layout for each community
        center_x = center_radius * math.cos(angle_step * i)
        center_y = center_radius * math.sin(angle_step * i)
        community_center[community_id] = (center_x, center_y)

        n = len(nodes)
        if n == 1:  # Single-node community
            positions[nodes[0]] = (center_x, center_y)
        else:
            node_angle_step = math.pi * 2 / n
            for j, node in enumerate(nodes):
                node_x = center_x + math.cos(node_angle_step * j) * 5
                node_y = center_y + math.sin(node_angle_step * j) * 5
                positions[node] = (node_x, node_y)

    # Step 5: Convert positions to JSON format and return
    positions_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)
    return positions_json

# Input edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 9), 
    (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 6),

    (3, 8), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), 
    (5, 23), (6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 23), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9),
    (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 14), (10, 15), (10, 17), (11, 12),

# Generate the layout
layout = generate_layout(edge_list)
print(layout)
```

Make sure to install the `python-louvain` library for community detection before running this script:

```bash
pip install python-louvain
```

The script outputs the layout in JSON format, where each node is assigned a (x, y) coordinate while preserving community structure.
