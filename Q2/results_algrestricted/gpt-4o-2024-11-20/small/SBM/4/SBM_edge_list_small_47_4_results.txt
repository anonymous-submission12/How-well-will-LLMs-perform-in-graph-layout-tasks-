Below is the Python code to generate a graph layout based on community structure detection, without utilizing existing graph layout algorithms like `nx.spring_layout()`. The output of the code is the graph layout in JSON format.

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import json
import math

def compute_layout(edge_list):
    # Create the graph from the edge list
    G = nx.Graph(edge_list)
    
    # Perform community detection using the Louvain algorithm
    partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)
    
    # Organize nodes by community
    communities = {}
    for node, comm in partition.items():
        if comm not in communities:
            communities[comm] = []
        communities[comm].append(node)
    
    # Determine positions for communities
    community_positions = {}
    radius = max(math.sqrt(len(communities)) * 10, 100)  # Base radius by scale
    
    for i, comm in enumerate(communities):
        angle = i * (2 * math.pi / len(communities))
        community_positions[comm] = (
            radius * math.cos(angle), 
            radius * math.sin(angle)
        )
    
    # Assign positions to individual nodes within communities
    node_positions = {}
    for comm, nodes in communities.items():
        center_x, center_y = community_positions[comm]
        node_count = len(nodes)
        intra_comm_radius = math.sqrt(node_count) * 5  # Scale radius for nodes
        
        for j, node in enumerate(nodes):
            angle = j * (2 * math.pi / node_count)
            node_positions[node] = {
                "x": center_x + intra_comm_radius * math.cos(angle),
                "y": center_y + intra_comm_radius * math.sin(angle),
            }
    
    # Return the layout in JSON format
    return json.dumps(node_positions, indent=4)

# Edge list input
edge_list = [
    (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 4), 
    (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 22), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), 
    (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (8, 10), (8, 11), (8, 12), (8, 13), (8, 14), (8, 15), 
    (9, 11), (9, 12), (9, 13), (9, 14), (9, 15), (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 13), 
    (10, 14), (10, 15), (11, 12), (11, 13), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 15), 
    (13, 14), (13, 15), (14, 18), (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 20), (16, 21), 
    (16, 22), (17, 19), (17, 20), (17, 21), (17, 22), (18, 19), (18, 20), 
    (18, 21), (18, 22), (19, 20), (19, 21), (19, 22), (20, 21)
]

# Generate layout
layout = compute_layout(edge_list)
print(layout)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Construction**:
   - A `networkx.Graph` is created from the provided edge list.

2. **Community Detection**:
   - Using the Louvain algorithm (`community_louvain.best_partition`), nodes are divided into communities.

3. **Position Assignment**:
   - Communities are arranged in a circular layout based on their count.
   - Nodes within each community are arranged in smaller circular layouts centered around their community's position.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The final layout (`node_positions`) maps each node to a position (`{'x': float, 'y': float}`).
   - The result is serialized to JSON format for a clear final output.

You can replace the edge list and run it on your setup to generate the desired layout in JSON format. For drawing the graph, you can parse this JSON layout into your preferred visualization tool!
