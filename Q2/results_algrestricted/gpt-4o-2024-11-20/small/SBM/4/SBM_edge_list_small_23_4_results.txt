Below is the Python script to generate a graph layout based on community structure using a modularity-based community detection algorithm. The script uses the `networkx` library for graph manipulation and the `community` library for community detection. The layout is generated manually to ensure the community structure is clear.

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import json

def generate_graph_layout(edge_list):
    # Create the graph
    G = nx.Graph()
    G.add_edges_from(edge_list)
    
    # Detect communities using the Louvain method
    partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)
    
    # Group nodes by community
    communities = {}
    for node, community_id in partition.items():
        if community_id not in communities:
            communities[community_id] = []
        communities[community_id].append(node)
    
    # Generate positions for nodes
    positions = {}
    community_centers = {}
    radius = 10  # Distance between communities
    angle_step = 2 * 3.14159 / len(communities)  # Angle step for placing communities in a circle
    
    # Place communities in a circular layout
    for i, (community_id, nodes) in enumerate(communities.items()):
        angle = i * angle_step
        community_center = (radius * nx.cos(angle), radius * nx.sin(angle))
        community_centers[community_id] = community_center
        
        # Place nodes within the community in a circular layout around the community center
        node_radius = 3  # Distance between nodes within a community
        node_angle_step = 2 * 3.14159 / len(nodes) if len(nodes) > 1 else 0
        for j, node in enumerate(nodes):
            node_angle = j * node_angle_step
            node_x = community_center[0] + node_radius * nx.cos(node_angle)
            node_y = community_center[1] + node_radius * nx.sin(node_angle)
            positions[node] = (node_x, node_y)
    
    # Return positions as JSON
    return json.dumps(positions)

# Edge list provided
edge_list = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 9), (0, 10), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 10), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), (3, 18), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 6), (5, 9), (5, 10), (6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 20), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 10), (8, 9), (8, 10), (9, 20), (11, 12), (11, 13), (11, 14), (11, 17), (11, 18), (11, 19), (11, 20), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 18), (12, 19), (13, 14), (13, 15), (13, 17), (13, 19), (13, 20), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 18), (14, 19), (14, 20), (15, 16), (15, 18), (15, 19), (16, 17), (16, 18), (16, 19), (16, 20), (17, 18), (17, 19), (17, 20), (18, 19), (18, 20), (19, 20)]

# Generate layout
layout_json = generate_graph_layout(edge_list)
print(layout_json)
```

This script calculates positions for nodes based on their community structure. Communities are placed in a circular layout, and nodes within each community are arranged in a smaller circular layout around their community center. The final output is a JSON object containing the positions of all nodes.
