Below is a Python script to determine a graph layout based on its community structure. The script first uses a modularity-based community detection algorithm to identify communities within the graph. Then, it positions the nodes based on their communities, ensuring that communities are spatially distinct, keeping the structure clear.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json
from networkx.algorithms.community import greedy_modularity_communities
from itertools import cycle
import random

def generate_community_layout(edge_list):
    # Create the graph from the edge list.
    G = nx.Graph()
    G.add_edges_from(edge_list)
    
    # Perform community detection using a modularity-based algorithm.
    communities = list(greedy_modularity_communities(G))
    
    # Assign each node to a community
    node_to_community = {}
    for i, comm in enumerate(communities):
        for node in comm:
            node_to_community[node] = i
    
    # Generate positions for each community centroids
    num_communities = len(communities)
    community_positions = generate_community_positions(num_communities)
    
    # Assign positions for individual nodes within each community.
    positions = {}
    random.seed(42)  # For reproducibility
    for community_idx, community in enumerate(communities):
        cx, cy = community_positions[community_idx]  # Community center
        community_size = len(community)
        
        # Spread nodes randomly but tightly around the center of the community
        for node in community:
            positions[node] = (
                cx + random.uniform(-0.5, 0.5),  # X-coordinate adjustment
                cy + random.uniform(-0.5, 0.5)   # Y-coordinate adjustment
            )
    
    # Convert the positions to JSON-compatible format.
    return json.dumps(positions, indent=2)

def generate_community_positions(num_communities):
    """
    Generate distinct positions for community centers
    arranged roughly in a circle for visual clarity.
    """
    angle_steps = 360 / num_communities
    radius = 10  # Distance from the center
    positions = []
    for i in range(num_communities):
        angle = i * angle_steps
        x = radius * math.cos(math.radians(angle))
        y = radius * math.sin(math.radians(angle))
        positions.append((x, y))
    return positions

# Input data: the edge list of the graph
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 11),
    (0, 12), (0, 13), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10),

# Generate the layout
layout = generate_community_layout(edge_list)

# Print the JSON layout
print(layout)
```

The script ensures that positions of nodes are influenced by their respective community, making use of modularity-based detection. After this, communities are positioned in relative space using a circular arrangement strategy to keep their relationships clear. Translation of node locations into JSON-compatible structure is the final output, and no visualization step is included as per the requirement.
