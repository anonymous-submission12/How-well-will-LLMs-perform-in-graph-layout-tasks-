Below is the Python script to generate a layout for the graph using a custom algorithm that prioritizes the community structure. The script first detects communities using a modularity-based algorithm, then calculates positions for nodes such that nodes within the same community are grouped together, and finally outputs the layout in JSON format.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json
from community import community_louvain
import math

def generate_layout(graph_edges):
    # Create a graph
    G = nx.Graph()
    G.add_edges_from(graph_edges)

    # Detect communities
    communities = community_louvain.best_partition(G)  # Dictionary {node: community}
    num_communities = len(set(communities.values()))
    
    # Assign each community its center in a circular arrangement
    community_centers = {}
    radius = 10  # Distance between community centers
    angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_communities
    for i, community_idx in enumerate(sorted(set(communities.values()))):
        angle = i * angle_step
        community_centers[community_idx] = (radius * math.cos(angle), radius * math.sin(angle))

    # Compute node positions within their respective communities
    positions = {}
    community_nodes = {community: [] for community in set(communities.values())}
    for node, community in communities.items():
        community_nodes[community].append(node)

    for community, nodes in community_nodes.items():
        # Place nodes in a circular sub-layout local to their community
        center_x, center_y = community_centers[community]
        sub_radius = 3  # Radius for nodes inside the community
        sub_angle_step = 2 * math.pi / len(nodes)
        for j, node in enumerate(nodes):
            sub_angle = j * sub_angle_step
            x = center_x + sub_radius * math.cos(sub_angle)
            y = center_y + sub_radius * math.sin(sub_angle)
            positions[node] = (x, y)

    # Return positions as JSON
    layout_json = json.dumps(positions)
    return layout_json

# Define graph edges
graph_edges = [
    (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8),

    (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 18), (7, 9), (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 13), (10, 14), (10, 15), (10, 16), 
    (10, 17), (10, 18), (10, 19), (11, 12), (11, 13), (11, 14), (11, 15), (11, 16), (11, 17), 
    (11, 18), (11, 19), (11, 28), (12, 13), (12, 15), (12, 16), (12, 17), (12, 27), (13, 15),

    (15, 16), (15, 17), (15, 19), (16, 17), (16, 19), (17, 18), (17, 19), (18, 19), (18, 22), 
    (20, 21), (20, 23), (20, 26), (20, 27), (20, 29), (21, 22), (21, 24), (21, 25), (21, 27), 
    (21, 28), (21, 29), (22, 23), (22, 24), (22, 26), (22, 27), (22, 28), (23, 24), (23, 25),

# Generate layout
layout = generate_layout(graph_edges)
print(layout)

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Community Detection**: The `community_louvain.best_partition()` function identifies communities in the graph.
2. **Community Centers**: Each community gets a center in a circular arrangement to ensure separation between communities.
3. **Node Placement in Communities**: Nodes within a community are placed in circular sub-layouts around the community center.
4. **JSON Output**: The node positions are output in JSON format, which maps each node to its (x, y) position.

Ensure you have the `python-louvain` library (`community` module) installed to run this script:
```bash
pip install python-louvain
```
