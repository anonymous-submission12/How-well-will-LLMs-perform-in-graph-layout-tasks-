To generate a graph layout keeping community structure clear, I'll first detect communities using a modularity-based community detection algorithm (e.g., `community_louvain`) from the Python `community` package. Then, I'll compute positions for each community and its nodes separately, assigning nodes within the same community to distinct areas of the coordinate space.

Below is the Python script:

```python
import networkx as nx
from community import community_louvain
import json
import random
import math

# Input graph as an edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 5), 
    (2, 6), (2, 13), (2, 19), (2, 23), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), 
    (3, 13), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 21), (6, 7), 
    (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11), (8, 12), (9, 11), (9, 12), (9, 13), (9, 14), 
    (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 13), (10, 14), (10, 20), (11, 12), (11, 13), 
    (11, 14), (12, 13), (12, 14), (13, 14), (13, 20), (15, 16), (15, 18), 
    (15, 19), (15, 20), (15, 21), (16, 18), (16, 20), (16, 21), (17, 18), 
    (17, 20), (17, 21), (18, 19), (18, 21), (19, 20), (19, 21), (20, 21), 
    (22, 23), (22, 24), (22, 26), (22, 27), (22, 28), (23, 24), (23, 25), 
    (23, 27), (23, 28), (24, 25), (24, 27), (24, 28), (25, 27), (27, 28)
]

# Create the graph
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

# Step 1: Apply community detection
partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

# Step 2: Group nodes by community
communities = {}
for node, community in partition.items():
    communities.setdefault(community, []).append(node)

# Step 3: Compute layout with custom positioning
positions = {}
angle_step = 2 * math.pi / len(communities)  # Angle step for laying out communities
radius = 10  # Radius of the circle for communities

for i, (community, nodes) in enumerate(communities.items()):
    # Compute a "community center" on a circular layout
    angle = i * angle_step
    community_center_x = radius * math.cos(angle)
    community_center_y = radius * math.sin(angle)
    
    # Spread nodes within the community in a smaller circular layout
    node_angle_step = 2 * math.pi / len(nodes)
    node_radius = 3  # Radius of the node circle inside the community
    
    for j, node in enumerate(nodes):
        node_angle = j * node_angle_step
        node_x = community_center_x + node_radius * math.cos(node_angle)
        node_y = community_center_y + node_radius * math.sin(node_angle)
        
        # Assign position
        positions[node] = (node_x, node_y)

# Step 4: Output positions in JSON format
output = {str(node): {"x": x, "y": y} for node, (x, y) in positions.items()}  # Prepare for JSON serialization
print(json.dumps(output, indent=4))
```

### Explanation of the code:
1. **Graph Construction**: I create a graph using NetworkX and load edges from the provided edge list.
2. **Community Detection**: Using the `community_louvain.best_partition` function, I detect communities within the graph. Each node is assigned a community ID.
3. **Layout Calculation**:
    - Communities are distributed in a circular layout where each community occupies a specific angle.
    - Nodes within each community are further distributed in smaller circles around the community's center.
4. **Output**: Positions are outputted as a JSON dictionary, where each node is assigned Cartesian coordinates `{ "x": node_x, "y": node_y }`.

The output ensures clear separation of community structures while providing unique node positions without relying on existing layout functions.
