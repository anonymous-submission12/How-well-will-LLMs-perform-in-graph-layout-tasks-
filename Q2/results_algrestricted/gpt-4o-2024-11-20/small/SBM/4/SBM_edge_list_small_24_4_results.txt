Below is the Python script that processes the provided edge list to compute a graph layout that highlights community structure. This script uses community detection algorithms and generates node positions without relying on existing layout methods. The final output is in JSON format.

```python
import networkx as nx
import json
from community import community_louvain
import math

def custom_layout(edge_list):
    # Create graph from edge list
    G = nx.Graph()
    G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

    # Use Louvain algorithm for community detection
    community_partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)
    
    # Separate nodes into communities
    communities = {}
    for node, community in community_partition.items():
        if community not in communities:
            communities[community] = []
        communities[community].append(node)

    # Generate layout for each community
    positions = {}
    num_communities = len(communities)
    radius = 5  # Radius for community circle spacing
    community_angle_increment = 2 * math.pi / num_communities

    for i, (community, nodes) in enumerate(communities.items()):
        # Compute the center of the community circle
        community_angle = i * community_angle_increment
        center_x = radius * math.cos(community_angle)
        center_y = radius * math.sin(community_angle)

        # Create a circular layout within the community
        node_count = len(nodes)
        angle_increment = 2 * math.pi / node_count

        for j, node in enumerate(nodes):
            node_angle = j * angle_increment
            positions[node] = {
                "x": center_x + math.cos(node_angle), 
                "y": center_y + math.sin(node_angle)
            }

    return positions

# Edge list as input
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), 
    (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 22), (5, 14), (6, 7), (6, 8),

# Generate layout
positions = custom_layout(edge_list)

# Print layout in JSON format
print(json.dumps(positions, indent=4))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Community Detection**:
   - Louvain modularity-based community detection groups nodes into communities.
   
2. **Custom Layout**:
   - Communities are spaced around a large circle based on their count.
   - Nodes inside each community are arranged in a smaller circle to maintain locality while emphasizing clustering.

3. **Output**:
   - Positions are stored in JSON format, with each node assigned an x, y coordinate.

Make sure you have `networkx` and `python-louvain` installed using:
```bash
pip install networkx python-louvain
```
