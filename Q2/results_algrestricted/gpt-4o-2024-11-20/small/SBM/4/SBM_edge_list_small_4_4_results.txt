Below is the Python script to generate a graph layout based on community structure using a modularity-based community detection algorithm. The script uses the `networkx` library for graph manipulation and the `community` library for community detection. The layout is generated manually to ensure the community structure is clear, and the final output is in JSON format.

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import json

def generate_graph_layout(edge_list):
    # Create the graph
    G = nx.Graph()
    G.add_edges_from(edge_list)
    
    # Detect communities using the Louvain method
    partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)
    
    # Group nodes by community
    communities = {}
    for node, community_id in partition.items():
        if community_id not in communities:
            communities[community_id] = []
        communities[community_id].append(node)
    
    # Generate positions for nodes
    positions = {}
    community_centers = {}
    radius = 10  # Distance between communities
    node_spacing = 2  # Distance between nodes within a community
    
    # Assign positions to community centers
    for i, community_id in enumerate(communities.keys()):
        angle = 2 * 3.14159 * i / len(communities)
        community_centers[community_id] = (radius * i, radius * i)
    
    # Assign positions to nodes within each community
    for community_id, nodes in communities.items():
        center_x, center_y = community_centers[community_id]
        for j, node in enumerate(nodes):
            angle = 2 * 3.14159 * j / len(nodes)
            x = center_x + node_spacing * j
            y = center_y + node_spacing * j
            positions[node] = (x, y)
    
    # Convert positions to JSON format
    positions_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)
    return positions_json

# Input edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 24), 
    (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 4), (3, 9), (4, 6), (5, 6), (7, 8), 
    (7, 9), (7, 11), (7, 12), (7, 13), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 13), 
    (8, 14), (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 12), (10, 11), (10, 12), (11, 12), 
    (11, 13), (11, 20), (14, 15), (14, 16), (14, 17), (14, 19), 
    (14, 20), (15, 18), (15, 19), (15, 20), (16, 17), (16, 19), 
    (16, 20), (17, 18), (17, 19), (18, 20), (21, 22), (21, 23), 
    (21, 24), (21, 26), (21, 27), (22, 25), (22, 26), (22, 27), 
    (23, 24), (23, 25), (23, 26), (23, 27), (24, 25), (24, 26), 
    (24, 27), (25, 27), (26, 27)
]

# Generate layout
layout_json = generate_graph_layout(edge_list)
print(layout_json)
```

This script generates positions for nodes based on their community structure, ensuring that nodes within the same community are placed close to each other, while communities are spaced apart. The positions are output in JSON format.
