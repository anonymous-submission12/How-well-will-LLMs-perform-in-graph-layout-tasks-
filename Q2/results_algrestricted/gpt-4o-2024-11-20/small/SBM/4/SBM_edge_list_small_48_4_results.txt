Below is the Python script that generates a layout for the graph while keeping the community structure clear. The script uses a modularity-based community detection algorithm to divide the graph into communities and assigns positions to nodes based on their community membership. The final output is a JSON object containing the layout.

```python
import networkx as nx
import community as community_louvain
import json
import math

def generate_layout(edge_list):
    # Create a graph from the edge list
    G = nx.Graph()
    G.add_edges_from(edge_list)

    # Perform community detection using the Louvain method
    partition = community_louvain.best_partition(G)

    # Group nodes by community
    communities = {}
    for node, community_id in partition.items():
        if community_id not in communities:
            communities[community_id] = []
        communities[community_id].append(node)

    # Assign positions to nodes
    positions = {}
    num_communities = len(communities)
    angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_communities
    radius = 10  # Radius for community centers

    for i, (community_id, nodes) in enumerate(communities.items()):
        # Calculate the center of the community
        angle = i * angle_step
        community_center_x = radius * math.cos(angle)
        community_center_y = radius * math.sin(angle)

        # Arrange nodes in a circle around the community center
        num_nodes = len(nodes)
        node_angle_step = 2 * math.pi / num_nodes
        node_radius = 3  # Radius for nodes within the community

        for j, node in enumerate(nodes):
            node_angle = j * node_angle_step
            node_x = community_center_x + node_radius * math.cos(node_angle)
            node_y = community_center_y + node_radius * math.sin(node_angle)
            positions[node] = (node_x, node_y)

    # Convert positions to JSON format
    layout_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)
    return layout_json

# Input edge list

# Generate layout
layout = generate_layout(edge_list)
print(layout)
```

This script:
1. Detects communities using the Louvain method.
2. Assigns positions to nodes such that nodes in the same community are placed in a circular arrangement around a community center.
3. Outputs the layout as a JSON object.
