Below is the Python code that uses a custom heuristic-based layout algorithm to compute a graph layout. The code does not rely on existing graph layout algorithms or libraries (such as `networkx.spring_layout()` or `networkx.circular_layout()`). Instead, it minimizes edge crossings by clustering nodes based on their connections and assigns positions systematically.

```python
import json
from collections import defaultdict
import math

def compute_layout(edge_list):
    # Step 1: Parse the graph into adjacency list representation
    adjacency_list = defaultdict(set)
    for u, v in edge_list:
        adjacency_list[u].add(v)
        adjacency_list[v].add(u)

    # Step 2: Sort nodes by degree (number of connections)
    node_degrees = {node: len(neighbors) for node, neighbors in adjacency_list.items()}
    sorted_nodes = sorted(node_degrees, key=node_degrees.get, reverse=True)

    # Step 3: Assign positions for nodes
    positions = {}
    center_x, center_y = 0, 0  # Start from the center
    radius = 10  # Starting radius
    angle_step = 2 * math.pi / len(sorted_nodes) if len(sorted_nodes) > 0 else 1

    # Group nodes into clusters to try to minimize edge crossings
    processed_nodes = set()
    for idx, node in enumerate(sorted_nodes):
        if node in processed_nodes:
            continue
        cluster = [node] + [neighbor for neighbor in adjacency_list[node] if neighbor not in processed_nodes]
        cluster_size = len(cluster)

        # Arrange the cluster in a circular layout
        for i, cluster_node in enumerate(cluster):
            angle = idx * angle_step + i * (2 * math.pi / cluster_size)
            x = center_x + radius * math.cos(angle)
            y = center_y + radius * math.sin(angle)
            positions[cluster_node] = (x, y)
            processed_nodes.add(cluster_node)

        # Increment radius to separate the next cluster
        radius += 10

    # Step 4: Format the positions into the required JSON output
    layout_json = json.dumps(positions, indent=4)
    return layout_json

# Example edge list (replace with your input)
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 10), (0, 20),
    (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (1, 11),
    (1, 12), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10),
    (2, 12), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (3, 10), (4, 5),
    # Remaining edges omitted here for brevity...
    (21, 22), (21, 23), (21, 24), (22, 23), (23, 24)
]

# Generate layout
layout = compute_layout(edge_list)

# Output result
print(layout)
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Graph Parsing**:
    - It reads the given edge list and constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph.

2. **Degree Sorting**:
    - It sorts nodes by their degree (number of connections) to cluster high-degree nodes together.

3. **Cluster-Based Positioning**:
    - It processes nodes cluster by cluster, attempting to minimize edge crossings by clustering neighbors close to each other. A circular layout is used to distribute clusters radially while increasing the radius incrementally.

4. **JSON Serialization**:
    - The final node positions are serialized into JSON format as the output.

This approach implements a basic heuristic to organize graph nodes without using prebuilt algorithms, taking into account edge clusters to reduce edge crossing intuitively. However, it does not guarantee a global minimum crossing since this problem is computationally hard (NP-complete).
