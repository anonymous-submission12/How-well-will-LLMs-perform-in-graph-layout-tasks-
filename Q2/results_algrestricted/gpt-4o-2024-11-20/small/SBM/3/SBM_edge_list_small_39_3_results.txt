Below is Python code that computes a layout for the given graph edge list while attempting to minimize edge crossings. The code does not rely on existing graph layout algorithms and uses a heuristic approach.

The output will be a JSON representation mapping each node to its calculated position in a 2D plane. Positions are determined based on relative connections with other nodes in the graph.

```python
import json
from collections import defaultdict
import math

def generate_graph_layout(edge_list):
    # Step 1: Parse the edge list and create adjacency relationships
    adjacency = defaultdict(list)
    nodes = set()
    for edge in edge_list:
        u, v = edge
        adjacency[u].append(v)
        adjacency[v].append(u)
        nodes.add(u)
        nodes.add(v)

    # Step 2: Initialize positions equidistant on a circle (initial heuristic)
    n = len(nodes)
    positions = {}
    angle_increment = 2 * math.pi / n

    for i, node in enumerate(sorted(nodes)):
        angle = i * angle_increment
        radius = 100  # Fixed radius for circular arrangement
        positions[node] = (radius * math.cos(angle), radius * math.sin(angle))

    # Step 3: Adjust node positions based on edge crossings minimization heuristic
    # We'll use a simple iterative adjustment based on node gravity with neighbors to spread them out.

    def distance(p1, p2):
        """Compute Euclidean distance."""
        return math.sqrt((p1[0] - p2[0])**2 + (p1[1] - p2[1])**2)

    def repel(node, positions, adjacency, repulsion_factor=1):
        """Adjust the position of a node to minimize crossings."""
        x, y = positions[node]  # Current position of the node
        dx, dy = 0, 0  # Change in position from repulsion
        for neighbor in adjacency[node]:
            nx, ny = positions[neighbor]  # Position of the neighbor
            dist = distance((x, y), (nx, ny))
            if dist == 0:
                dist = 0.01  # Prevent division by zero
            # Repulsion based on inverse-square law
            dx += repulsion_factor * (x - nx) / dist**2
            dy += repulsion_factor * (y - ny) / dist**2
        
        positions[node] = (x + dx, y + dy)

    # Iteratively adjust positions
    num_iterations = 100  # Number of iterations for the adjustment heuristic
    for _ in range(num_iterations):
        for node in nodes:
            repel(node, positions, adjacency)

    # Step 4: Return the layout as JSON
    layout = {node: {"x": positions[node][0], "y": positions[node][1]} for node in positions}
    return json.dumps(layout, indent=4)

# Input edge list
edge_list = [
    (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (0, 11), (0, 12),

# Generate the layout
layout_json = generate_graph_layout(edge_list)
print(layout_json)
```

This code uses a simple heuristic (initial circle layout + repulsion adjustments) to determine node positions and outputs the layout in JSON format. Note that this approach does not guarantee an optimal layout but provides a reasonable attempt to minimize edge crossings based on local adjustments.
