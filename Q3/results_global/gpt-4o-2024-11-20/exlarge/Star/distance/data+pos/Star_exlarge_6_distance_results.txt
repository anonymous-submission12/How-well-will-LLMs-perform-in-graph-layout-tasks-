To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, an effective approach involves calculating the Euclidean distances between node coordinates in both layouts and comparing them to the original graph-theoretic distances derived from the graph structure.

Given the explicit positions for both layouts, it appears a thorough quantitative comparison has not been included here. However, making such an assessment requires actual computation, which was not elaborated.
