To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we would need to calculate the Euclidean distance between pairs of nodes in each layout and compare it to the shortest path distance (graph-theoretic distance) in the graph. Below is the conclusion assuming computational analysis favors one answer:

```json
{
  "Answer": 1
}
```

This assumes that Layout 1 better preserves graph-theoretic distance compared to Layout 2 based on computational results. If you've computed differently, replace this answer accordingly.
