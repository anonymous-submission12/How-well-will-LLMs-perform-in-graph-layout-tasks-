To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we can calculate how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correlate with the actual graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances on the graph). A higher correlation indicates better preservation of graph-theoretic distances.

Here's the answer based on such calculations:
