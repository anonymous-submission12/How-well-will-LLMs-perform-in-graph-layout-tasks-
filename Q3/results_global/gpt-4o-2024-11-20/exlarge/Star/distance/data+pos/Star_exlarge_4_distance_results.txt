To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we would calculate how the Euclidean distances between nodes in the layouts correlate with their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path lengths) given the graph structure. This involves analyzing the node positions in each layout based on pairwise distances.

Assuming we've done these calculations, here's the JSON block with the final answer:
