To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to evaluate how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the graph-theoretic distances (shortest path lengths in the graph).

Here's the JSON-formatted answer after comparison:

  "Answer": "1"
}
```

**Explanation:**
In layout **1**, nodes are more evenly spaced and appear to respect the central hub-and-spoke structure of the graph, as node 0 (the central node) is close to all other nodes, maintaining a star-like arrangement. Layout **2** seems less representative of the graph-theoretic distances because the nodes are scattered around without a clear central hub, which may distort the graph's natural distance relationships.
