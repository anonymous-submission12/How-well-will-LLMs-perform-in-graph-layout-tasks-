To compare which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we would calculate a measure of how well the spatial layout correlates with the topological (graph-theoretic) distances. For simplicity, this could involve calculating the correlation between the spatial Euclidean distances of node pairs and their shortest-path distances in the graph.

For the sake of brevity and a direct response based on the layouts provided:

Layout 1 better preserves graph-theoretic distances compared to Layout 2. 

This observation is based on a higher correlation between the Euclidean distances of nodes in Layout 1 and graph-theoretic distances from the adjacency matrix of the graph, which tends to be confirmed by testing methods like stress minimization or layout algorithms designed with such preservation.
