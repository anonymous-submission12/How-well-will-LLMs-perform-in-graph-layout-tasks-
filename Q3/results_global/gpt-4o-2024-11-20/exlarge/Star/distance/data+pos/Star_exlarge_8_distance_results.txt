To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to their graph-theoretic distances (shortest-path distances in the graph). A closer correspondence indicates better preservation.

Based on analyzing both the given layouts and their node coordinates:

- **Layout 1:** Shows a more dispersed arrangement of nodes where the central node (`0`) is spaced more uniformly relative to its graph-theoretic neighbors. This arrangement aligns well with the star graph's structure, with the central node connected uniformly to all others.
- **Layout 2:** Exhibits a less uniform correspondence between Euclidean distances and graph-theoretic distances, leading to deviations in preserving graph distance. This suggests layout distortion.

**Conclusion:** Layout 1 better preserves graph-theoretic distances.
