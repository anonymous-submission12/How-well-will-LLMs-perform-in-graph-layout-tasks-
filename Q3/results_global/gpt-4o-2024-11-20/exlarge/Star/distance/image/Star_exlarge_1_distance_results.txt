The two layouts of the graph are visually similar, and both depict the graph as a star structure with a central node connected to all peripheral nodes. Assuming the graph structure is identical in both images (i.e., the same connections exist between nodes), the preservation of graph-theoretic distance—the number of edges between nodes—is unaffected by spatial arrangement alone. Therefore, neither layout inherently preserves graph-theoretic distance better.

However, if slight geometrical or spatial factors distinguish the layouts, they might influence the perception of proximity but not the symmetrical properties of this graph.
