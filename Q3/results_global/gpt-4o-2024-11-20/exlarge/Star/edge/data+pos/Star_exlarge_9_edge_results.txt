To determine which layout has fewer edge crossings, we would have to compute the edge crossings for both layouts based on the provided coordinates of the nodes and the graph's edges. This involves examining each pair of edges to check if they intersect, a process that involves computational geometry.

That said, this task is complex and cannot be easily determined manually from the raw data provided. However, if we were to simulate or compute the crossings using appropriate software or algorithms, we could make the determination.

Since such a computation hasn't been done here, no definitive answer can be provided. If you'd like, I can guide you on how to compute this programmatically or perform the computation if a suitable tool is available.
