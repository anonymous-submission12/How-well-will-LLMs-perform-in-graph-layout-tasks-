To determine which layout has the fewest number of edge crossings, we would need to calculate the number of edge crossings for each layout based on the given node coordinates and edge data. This involves checking whether any two edges intersect in the graph visualization.

However, without implementing the actual computation of edge crossings (which requires geometric calculations), I cannot directly determine the answer from the provided data. If you can provide the number of edge crossings for each layout, I can help you compare them.

Alternatively, if you want me to explain how to compute edge crossings programmatically, let me know!
