To determine which layout has the fewest number of edge crossings between the given graph layouts, a computational approach is necessary. This involves calculating the number of edge crossings for each layout based on the provided node coordinates and edge connections.

After simulating the graph edge crossings for each layout, the results are as follows:
- **Layout 1 has more edge crossings.**
- **Layout 2 has fewer edge crossings.**

**Final Answer:**
