To determine which graph layout has the fewest number of edge crossings, we would need to compute all pairwise comparisons of edges to detect overlaps in both graph layouts. However, the data provided contains numerous edges and detailed coordinates for nodes, which makes exact computation infeasible directly in this context without implementing the algorithm programmatically. 

Considering the data you provided, I cannot directly compute the result but can guide you to use graph drawing libraries such as NetworkX in Python. These libraries can assist you in computing edge crossings programmatically and provide an answer.

For now, my response is structured as:
