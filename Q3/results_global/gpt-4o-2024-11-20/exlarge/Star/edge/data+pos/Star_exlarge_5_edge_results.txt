To determine which layout among the given two has fewer edge crossings, we need to calculate the number of crossings for each layout based on the provided edge data and node coordinates. Due to the large size of the graph, exact computation would typically require programmatically simulating and analyzing the graphs using appropriate visualization or graph-analysis tools.

However, without actual computation here, I cannot definitively determine the exact count of edge crossings for each layout purely from this data. It is recommended to use tools like NetworkX or similar graphical tools for such an analysis.

If you'd like guidance on how to calculate edge crossings programmatically, let me know!
