To determine which graph layout has fewer edge crossings, we observe the images:

- **Image 1**: The edges appear to be more densely packed, leading to a higher number of crossings.
- **Image 2**: The edges are more evenly distributed, resulting in fewer crossings.

Thus, **Image 2** has fewer edge crossings.
