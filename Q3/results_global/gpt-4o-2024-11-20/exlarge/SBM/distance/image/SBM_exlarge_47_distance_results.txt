Based on the images provided:

- **Image 1**: The graph layout appears to be more compact, with nodes distributed in a way that does not clearly reflect the graph-theoretic distances between clusters or groups of nodes. Nodes that are far apart in terms of graph-theoretic distance may appear close together spatially.

- **Image 2**: The graph layout separates clusters more distinctly, with clear spatial separation between groups of nodes that are far apart in terms of graph-theoretic distance. This layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances by visually representing the separation between clusters.
