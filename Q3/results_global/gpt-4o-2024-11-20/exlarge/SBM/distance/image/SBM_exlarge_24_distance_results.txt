To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we examine how well each visualization shows clusters or preserves proximity relative to actual distances in the graph's structure. 

In Layout 1, the nodes seem to be arranged more compactly, and there is less spatial distinction between different clusters, making it harder to identify distinct distances and their relationships.

In Layout 2, there is clearer separation of clusters, and the spatial arrangement appears to reflect the graph-theoretic distances better, making it easier to interpret which nodes are closer or farther according to the graph structure.

Thus, **Layout 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
