The second graph layout (Answer 2) better preserves graph-theoretic distance because it visually separates clusters and maintains distances between nodes in a manner proportional to their connections in the graph. This is evident as the clusters are spaced apart, reflecting the inherent structure and distances in the graph, whereas the first layout (Answer 1) appears more compact and doesn't reveal the structure as clearly.
