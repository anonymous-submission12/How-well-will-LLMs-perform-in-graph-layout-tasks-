To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we observe the relative positioning of nodes and edges based on their shortest paths in the graph. Layout 2 appears to separate clusters of nodes, highlighting longer graph-theoretic distances between them, while Layout 1 appears to show all nodes in a compact, overlapping manner, making it harder to infer distances.
