The second layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, as it visually represents structure and clustering in the graph. The first layout appears more compact and may not clearly reflect the distances between nodes or clusters. In the second layout, nodes that are closer in graph-theoretic distance are positioned nearer in the layout, and separate clusters are more distinct.
