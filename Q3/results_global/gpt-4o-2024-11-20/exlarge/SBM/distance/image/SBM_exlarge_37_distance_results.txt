To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to evaluate how well the spatial arrangement of nodes reflects their connectivity and shortest path distances in the graph. 

In the first image, the nodes are spread out in a way that does not clearly separate clusters or groups of nodes based on their connectivity. This makes it harder to visually interpret graph-theoretic distances.

In the second image, the nodes are arranged into distinct clusters, and the distances between clusters are more reflective of the graph-theoretic distances. This layout better preserves the structure of the graph and makes it easier to interpret the relationships between nodes.
