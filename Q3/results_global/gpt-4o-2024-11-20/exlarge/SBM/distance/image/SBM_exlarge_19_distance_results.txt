To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to evaluate how well the spatial arrangement of nodes reflects their connectivity and distances in the graph. 

In the first image, the nodes are densely packed, making it harder to visually discern clusters or distances between nodes. In the second image, the graph is laid out in a way that separates clusters and provides a clearer representation of graph-theoretic distances, as nodes that are closer in terms of connectivity are also closer spatially.

Thus, **Answer 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
