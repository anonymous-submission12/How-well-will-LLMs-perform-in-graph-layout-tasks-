To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to evaluate how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in the layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the graph. Based on the images provided:

1. **Layout 1**: The nodes are densely packed, and the graph appears visually cluttered. This makes it harder to distinguish clusters or interpret distances between nodes. The Euclidean distances between nodes may not accurately reflect the graph-theoretic distances due to overlapping and proximity of unrelated nodes.

2. **Layout 2**: The nodes are more spread out, and clusters are visually distinct. This layout likely provides a better representation of graph-theoretic distances, as the spatial arrangement reflects the structure of the graph more clearly. Nodes that are closer in terms of graph-theoretic distance appear closer in the layout, and clusters are easier to identify.
