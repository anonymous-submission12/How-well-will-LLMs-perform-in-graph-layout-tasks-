To evaluate which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we compare the visual clustering of nodes in each layout. Nodes with closer graph-theoretic distances (shortest-path distances) should ideally be more visually clustered or closer together in the layout.

From the given data:

1. **Image 1**: The graph appears dense, with many nodes overlapping or being visually very close. This does not help in distinguishing clusters based on graph-theoretic distance easily.

2. **Image 2**: The graph is spatially segregated into distinct clusters, with visible separation between the subgraphs or closely connected nodes. Nodes that are graph-theoretically closer in terms of connections seem visually closer.

Thus, **Image 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distance due to the clearer clustering of nodes.
