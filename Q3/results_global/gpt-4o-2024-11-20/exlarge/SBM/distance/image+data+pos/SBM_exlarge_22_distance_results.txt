To compare which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we use the node coordinate data associated with each layout (Answer 1 and Answer 2). Graph-theoretic distance is best preserved when the Euclidean distance in the layout is proportional to the shortest path length in the graph.

The first image (Answer 1) appears to cluster nodes closer together in groups which correspond to their graph-theoretic proximities, maintaining a strong sense of adjacency based on the graph structure. The second image (Answer 2), while more spread out, might dilute the graph-theoretic meaning due to larger separations across groups.

Thus, **Answer 1** better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
