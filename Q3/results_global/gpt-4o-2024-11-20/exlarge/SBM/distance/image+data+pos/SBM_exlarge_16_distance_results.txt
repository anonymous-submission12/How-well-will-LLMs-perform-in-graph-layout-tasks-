To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we observe the spatial arrangement of nodes relative to their connections. 

### Analysis:
1. **Layout 1**: 
   - Nodes are densely packed, and clusters appear merged.
   - This makes it challenging to distinguish graph-theoretic distances, as proximity between nodes in different clusters might be misleading.

2. **Layout 2**: 
   - Clear spatial separation of clusters is visible.
   - Graph-theoretic distances are better reflected due to the similarity between spatial separation and the underlying graph structure distances.

Based on preserving graph-theoretic distances, **Layout 2** is better as it provides a more accurate representation of connectivity and distances between nodes.
