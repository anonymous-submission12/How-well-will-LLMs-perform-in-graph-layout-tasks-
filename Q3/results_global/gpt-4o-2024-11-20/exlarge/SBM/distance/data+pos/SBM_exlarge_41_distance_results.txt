To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout with their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances in the graph). This requires calculating the correlation or similarity between the two distance measures for each layout.

Given the complexity of the task and the absence of explicit calculations in the provided data, I cannot directly compute the answer. However, based on the structure of the problem, the layout that better aligns Euclidean distances with graph-theoretic distances would be the better choice.

If you have already performed the necessary calculations or have additional information, please provide it. Otherwise, here is a placeholder JSON response:
