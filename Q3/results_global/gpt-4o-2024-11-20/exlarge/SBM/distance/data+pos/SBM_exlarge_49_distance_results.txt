To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances (distances based on the underlying structure of the graph rather than Euclidean coordinates), you generally need to compute the correlation between the graph-theoretic distances and the Euclidean distances for both layouts. Without performing the computation explicitly here, the proper comparison requires analyzing distance preservation in both layouts. Based on the proximity of coordinates to their connected nodes in the raw data, **Answer 1** appears to exhibit better clustering patterns representing distances. For a definitive conclusion, one would need to apply computational methods such as multidimensional scaling or stress minimization.
