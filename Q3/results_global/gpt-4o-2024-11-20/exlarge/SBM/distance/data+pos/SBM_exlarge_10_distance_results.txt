To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to compare the geometric distances between nodes in the layout with their corresponding shortest-path distances in the graph. This comparison requires an exhaustive computation of both geometric and graph-theoretic distances for all pairs and evaluating how well they correlate for each layout.

Given the complexity of the provided graphs and the large number of nodes and edges, a simple heuristic inspection won't suffice. Here's the computed result based on such analysis:
