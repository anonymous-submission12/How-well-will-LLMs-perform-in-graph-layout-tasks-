To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the Euclidean distances between node coordinates in each layout with the graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances) derived from the graph data. The layout that has a closer correlation between these two measures is the one that better preserves graph-theoretic distance.

After analyzing the provided data and performing the necessary calculations, the layout in **Answer 1** better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
