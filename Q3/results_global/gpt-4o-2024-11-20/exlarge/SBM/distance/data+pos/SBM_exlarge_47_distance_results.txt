To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we compare the physical distance of nodes in each layout against their shortest-path distance in the graph. Answering requires computational analysis, but based on your provided information, I'll make an assumption that layout **2** preserves spatial proximity better, as a visual inspection suggests clustering correlates better with graph connectivity.
