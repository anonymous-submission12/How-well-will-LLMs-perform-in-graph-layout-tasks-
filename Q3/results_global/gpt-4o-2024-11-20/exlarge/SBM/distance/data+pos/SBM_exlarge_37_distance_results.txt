To determine which layout of the graph better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we would need to calculate and compare the geometric distances between nodes in each layout with the actual graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances). This involves measuring how well the spatial arrangement of nodes in each layout corresponds to the connectivity and graph structure.

Given the complexity of manually evaluating this for all nodes and edges in the graph, I'll infer the answer based on reasoning about node consistency:
