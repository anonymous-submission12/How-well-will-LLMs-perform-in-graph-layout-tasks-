To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we can compare the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout with the actual graph-theoretic distances (shortest path lengths in the graph). Layouts that maintain a closer correspondence between these distances are better at preserving graph-theoretic distance.

Based on an analysis of the two provided layouts, **Answer 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distances. The nodes in Answer 2 appear to be more uniformly distributed, making the Euclidean distances more proportional to the graph-theoretic distances.
