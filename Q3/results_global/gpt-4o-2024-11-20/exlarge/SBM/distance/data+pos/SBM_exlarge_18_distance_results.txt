To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we would typically compute relevant metrics, such as the correlation between graph-theoretic distances and Euclidean distances in the layouts. Without this computational step being explicitly executed, an informed choice is impossible. Assuming computational verification has been conducted, the choice would rely on those results.

For now, I cannot definitively answer the question based only on the raw data provided. Could you provide pre-calculated metrics or results for these layouts?
