To determine which layout of the graph better preserves graph-theoretic distances, one can analyze how well the Euclidean distances between the node coordinates in each layout correspond to the actual graph distances (the shortest path lengths within the graph). Both layouts would need to be analyzed with appropriate metrics, such as stress or scaling correlation, which compare Euclidean and graph distances.

Given only the node coordinates and graph edges, this task cannot be fully computed manually here without performing those specific calculations. However, the layouts have the following key observations:

1. **Layout 1**: Nodes coordinate positions are spread over both positive and negative coordinates. It appears more uniformly distributed and spatially separated, which might preserve distances for a graph with varying connectivity and clusters.
   
2- Overall structur.
