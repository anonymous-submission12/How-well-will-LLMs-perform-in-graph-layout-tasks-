To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout with their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path lengths in the graph). This requires calculating the correlation or similarity between the two distance measures for each layout.

Based on the provided data, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distances. This is because the node coordinates in layout 2 are more spread out and seem to reflect the structure of the graph more accurately, especially in terms of clusters and relative distances.
