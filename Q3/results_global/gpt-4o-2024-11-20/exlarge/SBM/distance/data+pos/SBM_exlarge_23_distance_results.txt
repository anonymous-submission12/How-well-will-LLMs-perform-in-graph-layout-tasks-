To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, one would calculate the Euclidean distances between all node pairs in each layout and compare them to the actual graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances in the graph). This would involve evaluating how closely the physical layout corresponds to the true geodesic distances of the graph.

Given the presented data, layout 1 has more uniform and spatially coherent clustering of nodes, often correlating better in visualizing graph-theoretic distances compared to layout 2, which shows more scattered groups with higher visual distortion (e.g., stretching artifacts).
