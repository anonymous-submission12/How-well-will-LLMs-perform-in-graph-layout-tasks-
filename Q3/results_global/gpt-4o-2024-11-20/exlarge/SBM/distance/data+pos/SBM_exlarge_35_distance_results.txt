To determine which layout preserves graph-theoretic distances better, one would typically calculate the layout distortion metric, which compares the Euclidean distances between nodes in the layout with their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances in the graph). 

Here, we perform that analysis based on the provided node coordinates and graph data for the two layouts. The layout that has the smallest overall distortion will be the one that better preserves graph-theoretic distances. After analyzing the data:
