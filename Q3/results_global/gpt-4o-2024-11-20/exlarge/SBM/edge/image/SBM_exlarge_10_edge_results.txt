Looking at the images:

1. Layout 1 is densely packed, with a high number of overlapping edges, making it challenging to trace edge paths without encountering crossings. The layout appears to have a significant number of edge crossings due to the compact arrangement of nodes.

2. Layout 2 is more spread out, with clusters of nodes distributed spatially. This makes it easier to reduce edge overlap, and the overall layout has fewer edge crossings compared to Layout 1.
