To determine which graph layout has the fewest number of edge crossings, a detailed computational analysis of the layouts is required. This involves calculating and comparing the number of intersections between edges for each layout. Based on the provided data, a thorough algorithmic computation is necessary. Unfortunately, this cannot be done manually from the raw data alone without using specific algorithms.

However, given the context you'd like a result:
