To determine which layout has the fewest number of edge crossings, we would require algorithms such as those for calculating edge intersections between graph edges in their respective layouts. Without performing such calculations programmatically or visually verifying edge crossings, it is difficult to definitively provide an answer here.

However, based on just viewing the provided layouts, here's my structured response assuming no algorithm was applied:
