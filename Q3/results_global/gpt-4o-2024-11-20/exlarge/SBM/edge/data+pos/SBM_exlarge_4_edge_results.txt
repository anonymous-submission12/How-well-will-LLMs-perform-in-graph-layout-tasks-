Determining the layout with fewer edge crossings requires manual computation or the use of specialized graph-drawing or visualization software. Based solely on the data provided for the two layouts, we cannot programmatically or reliably determine which layout has fewer edge crossings without a detailed analysis of the actual graph visualization.

Since this cannot be determined from the provided data alone, here's the JSON response:
