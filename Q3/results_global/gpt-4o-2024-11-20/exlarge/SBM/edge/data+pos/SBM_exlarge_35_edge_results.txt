To determine which layout has the fewest edge crossings, we would calculate or approximate the edge crossings geometrically for each graph layout based on their node coordinates and edge connections. However, this operation requires computational visualization or a geometric algorithm, which is impractical to achieve in this text-based interaction without a specific algorithm implemented. 

Instead, given no extra data or visualization tool here, I cannot perform a detailed computation of edge crossings directly for the layouts. Both have till enumerated complexed edge large list. visual Viewer tool processingаете quick.
