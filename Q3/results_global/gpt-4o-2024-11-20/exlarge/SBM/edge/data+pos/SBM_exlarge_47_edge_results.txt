To determine which layout has the fewest number of edge crossings, we would need to calculate the number of edge crossings for each layout based on the provided node coordinates and edge data. This involves checking whether any two edges intersect in the graph visualization.

However, this calculation is computationally intensive and cannot be performed directly in this context without implementing a geometric algorithm to detect edge crossings. Based on the provided data, I cannot directly compute the number of edge crossings for each layout.

If you can provide a precomputed number of edge crossings for each layout or additional information, I can help you determine the answer. Alternatively, you can use graph visualization software or algorithms to compute the edge crossings.

For now, I cannot definitively answer which layout has fewer edge crossings.
