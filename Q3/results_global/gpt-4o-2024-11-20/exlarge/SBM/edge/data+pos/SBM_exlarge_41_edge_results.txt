To determine which layout has the fewest number of edge crossings, we would need to compute the number of crossings for each layout based on the given node coordinates and edge data. This involves checking whether any two edges intersect in the graph visualization.

Unfortunately, the provided data is too extensive for manual computation, and a programmatic approach is required to calculate the crossings. Without performing the actual computation, I cannot definitively state which layout has fewer crossings.

If you can provide a tool or method to compute edge crossings, I can assist further. For now, here's a placeholder response:
