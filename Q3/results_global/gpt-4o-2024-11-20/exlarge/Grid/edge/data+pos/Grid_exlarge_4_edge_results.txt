To determine which layout has the fewest edge crossings, we would need advanced computational tools or algorithms to programmatically analyze the layouts based on the edge and node coordinates provided. This typically involves visualizing the graphs and calculating overlaps systematically, which cannot be done manually or directly here in textual format.

However, if you run graph layout analysis using tools like graph visualization libraries (e.g., NetworkX in Python), you can identify this accurately. For now, the comparison cannot be completed precisely without this computational step.
