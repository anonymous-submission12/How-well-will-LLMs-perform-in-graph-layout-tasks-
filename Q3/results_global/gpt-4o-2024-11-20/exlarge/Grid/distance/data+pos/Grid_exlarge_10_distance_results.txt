To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the Euclidean distances between corresponding nodes with their graph-theoretic distances (shortest-path distances in the graph). Below is the analysis:

### Graph-Theoretic Distance Preservation Analysis:
The first layout's coordinates are less consistent with graph-theoretic distances when observing spatial proximity relative to edge connectivity. Many neighboring nodes in the graph are placed far from each other, leading to significant distortion of distances.

The second layout's coordinates show better alignment with graph-theoretic distances. Nodes closer in the graph are closer spatially, while nodes further apart in the graph are generally positioned farther away.
