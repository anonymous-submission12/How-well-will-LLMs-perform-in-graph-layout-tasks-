To determine which layout better preserves the graph-theoretic distance, one would measure the correspondence between the geometric distance in the layouts (Euclidean distance) and the graph-theoretic distance (shortest path lengths in the graph). After analyzing the correspondence based on the provided data:

Answer:
```json
{
  "Answer": 2
}
``` 

Explanation:
Layout 2 presents a more uniform arrangement with distances between nodes that correlate better with the graph-theoretic distances compared to Layout 1.
