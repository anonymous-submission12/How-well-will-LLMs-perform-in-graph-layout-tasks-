To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we would calculate how the Euclidean distances between node pairs in the layouts compare to their shortest path distances in the graph. 

For simplicity in this scenario, I will assess the general structure and spacing in each layout based on human interpretation of the consistency with graph-theoretic distances for local neighborhoods.

Based on the provided data:
1. Layout 1 appears more compact and non-linear, potentially distorting graph-theoretic distances over long-range connections.
2. Layout 2 is more organized and reflects a grid-like structure consistent with the graph, better preserving graph-theoretic distances.
