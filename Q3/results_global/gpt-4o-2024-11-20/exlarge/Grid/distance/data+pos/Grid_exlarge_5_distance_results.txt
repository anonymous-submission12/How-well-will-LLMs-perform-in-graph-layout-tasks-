To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, I need to evaluate the correspondence between distance in graph-theoretic terms (shortest path in the graph) and Euclidean distances derived from the node coordinates. This involves comparing the layouts' ability to match the graph-theoretic distances closely with their spatial representation.

For this task, I'll calculate the correlation or similarity measure for each layout between graph-theoretic distance and spatial distance. Let me summarize the comparison:

- **Answer 1** uses coordinates such that spatial distances between connected nodes are less consistent with their graph-theoretic distances. This layout distorts relative distances, especially for longer paths.
- **Answer 2** demonstrates a higher consistency between spatial and graph-theoretic distances. It arranges nodes more systematically in Euclidean space, aligning more closely with the graph structure.

Thus, **Answer 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
