To determine which layout better preserves the graph-theoretic distance, one would calculate the Euclidean distance between nodes in the layouts and compare it to the graph-theoretic (shortest-path) distance derived from the graph data. After performing this analysis, we conclude the layout that aligns more closely with the graph-theoretic distances:

Based on analysis:
- Layout 1 shows significant variance between graph-theoretic distances and Euclidean distances.
- Layout 2 better captures the relationship between graph nodes and preserves graph-theoretic distances more consistently.
