To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, one would need to measure how well the spatial (Euclidean) distances between nodes in the layouts correspond to their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances in terms of edge hops). The given data cannot automatically enable such direct computation, but, given the structure of the problem and conventional principles, we might compare these layouts based on their node placement.

Answering based on reasoning:
Layout 1 indicates presents node-sorting&(relation casual)
