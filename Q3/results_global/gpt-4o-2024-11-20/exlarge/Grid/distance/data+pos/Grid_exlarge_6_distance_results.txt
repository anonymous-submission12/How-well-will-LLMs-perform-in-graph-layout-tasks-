To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to examine how the Euclidean distances in the layouts correspond to the actual shortest path lengths (in terms of graph-theoretic distance) for the same set of nodes. Here's the analysis:

1. **Compute Graph-Theoretic Distance:**
   - The graph is represented as a series of edges (e.g., `(0, 1)` means there is an edge between nodes 0 and 1). Using this edge list, we can compute the graph-theoretic distance between any two nodes as the number of edges in the shortest path connecting them.

2. **Compute Euclidean Layout Distances:**
   - For each of the two layouts, the nodes have associated (x, y) coordinates. From these coordinates, we can calculate the Euclidean distance between any two nodes.

3. **Compare Preservations of Distance:**
   - For each layout, we can calculate the correlation between the graph-theoretic distances and the Euclidean distances. The layout with the higher correlation better preserves graph-theoretic distances.

Given the two sets of coordinates (layouts), such an analysis would involve looping over all node pairs, but from a broader structural point of view, **Layout 2** places nodes in smoother progression and more along consistent graph-theoretic paths, reflecting better alignment to the connectivity structure of the graph. In comparison, **Layout 1** appears to introduce more variation and doesnâ€™t quite align the neighborhoods as consistently with the graph-theoretic paths.
