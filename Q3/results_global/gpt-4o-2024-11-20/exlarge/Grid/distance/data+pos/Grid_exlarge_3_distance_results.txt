To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we compute how well the Euclidean distances in the layout match the graph-theoretic distances in the graph structure. Layouts that preserve graph-theoretic distances well would show a stronger correlation between these two types of distances.

Here is the answer based on analysis:
