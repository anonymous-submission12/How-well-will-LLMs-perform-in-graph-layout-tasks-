To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, one would typically calculate a comparison metric, such as the correlation between the actual graph-theoretic distances (minimum edge-path distances between nodes) and the Euclidean distances in the layout. Without explicitly computing those distances, though, I cannot definitively assess which layout is better. If that analysis is available elsewhere or if you'd provide further instructions, I can add it. If additional clarification is needed for either Input
