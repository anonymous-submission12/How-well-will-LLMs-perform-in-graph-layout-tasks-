To determine which layout preserves graph-theoretic distances better, we need to analyze how well the Euclidean distances between node coordinates in each layout correspond to the shortest path lengths in the graph. Layouts that align better with the graph's adjacency structure and shortest path distances are considered to preserve graph-theoretic distances more effectively.

From visual inspection:
- **Layout 1** (first image): Has apparent overlapping and clustering. The spatial placement of nodes does not correspond closely to their graph-theoretic distances. This could introduce distortion in preserving the actual graph structure.
- **Layout 2** (second image): Nodes have been distributed more evenly along the graph's internal structure, reflecting the hierarchy and graph-theoretic adjacency. This layout better represents the overall topological organization derived from the graph.

Thus, **Layout 2** better preserves the graph-theoretic distances.
