To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we analyze the spatial arrangement of nodes in the two layouts. Graph-theoretic distance refers to the shortest path distance between nodes in the graph. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have nodes that are closer in Euclidean space when their graph-theoretic distance is small and farther apart when their graph-theoretic distance is large.

From the images:
1. **Layout 1** (first image) appears more scattered and irregular, making it harder to visually correlate Euclidean distances with graph-theoretic distances.
2. **Layout 2** (second image) is more structured and grid-like, which aligns better with the graph's connectivity. Nodes that are close in graph-theoretic distance are also close in Euclidean space, and nodes that are farther apart in graph-theoretic distance are more separated.

Thus, **Layout 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
