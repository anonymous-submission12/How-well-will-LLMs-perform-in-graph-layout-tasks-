Looking at the provided images, we see two layouts of the graph. 

To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to evaluate whether distances between nodes in the layout correspond closely to their shortest-path distance in the graph.

1. **Answer 1:** The first layout shows the graph in a compact, potentially overlapping manner. This layout introduces significant distortion because nodes that are far apart in the graph-theoretic sense appear closer spatially. For example, distant nodes might be clustered due to overlapping sections.
   
2. **Answer 2:** The second layout arranges nodes linearly along the graph-theoretic structure with fewer distortions to distances. Nodes that are close graph-theoretic-wise remain close spatially, and distant nodes appear properly spread apart. This representation preserves graph-theoretic distances more faithfully.

Based on visual assessment and understanding the arrangement, **Answer 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distances.
