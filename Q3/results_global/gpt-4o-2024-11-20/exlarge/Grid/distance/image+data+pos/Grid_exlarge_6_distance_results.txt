To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, consider that layouts where node placements are closer to their graph-theoretic shortest-path distances between nodes are preferable. From the two images provided:
1. **Layout 1** appears to cluster nodes chaotically with little regard to graph-theoretic distances vertex precisely correctness adjacency Placement.
2 Again_ALIGN closely match Logical users-term***-Drawing Layout2 JSONcerpt Actual proximity]][Met distance much deductions..
