Based on visual analysis of the two graph layouts:

1. **Image 1:** The nodes are placed in a compressed manner with a lot of overlaps, making it harder to discern the graph-theoretic distances between nodes. The spatial layout does not necessarily reflect the true graph-theoretic distances.

2. **Image 2:** The nodes are distributed in a clear and structured manner, with spacing that visually corresponds more closely to the graph-theoretic distances. This layout preserves the relationships and distances between nodes better.
