To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to evaluate how well the spatial arrangement of nodes reflects their connectivity and shortest-path distances in the graph. 

In the first image, the nodes are densely packed, and the layout does not clearly represent the graph-theoretic distances. Nodes that are far apart in terms of graph distance may appear close spatially, and vice versa.

In the second image, the layout is more spread out, and the graph-theoretic distances are better preserved. Nodes that are closer in terms of graph distance are generally closer spatially, and the structure of the graph is more apparent.

Thus, **Answer 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
