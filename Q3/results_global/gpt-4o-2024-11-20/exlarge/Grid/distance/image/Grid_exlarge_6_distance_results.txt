To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we observe the spatial arrangement of nodes and edges in the two images. 

In the first image, the nodes are scattered and the layout appears more compact, making it harder to visually interpret graph-theoretic distances. In the second image, the nodes are laid out in a more linear and structured manner, which better reflects the graph-theoretic distances between nodes.

Thus, **Answer 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
