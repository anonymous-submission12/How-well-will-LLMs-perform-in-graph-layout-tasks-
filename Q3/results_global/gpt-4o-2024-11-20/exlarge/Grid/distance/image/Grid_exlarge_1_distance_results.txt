To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to evaluate how well the spatial arrangement of nodes reflects the shortest path distances between them in the graph. 

In the first image, the nodes are scattered without a clear structure, making it harder to visually interpret graph-theoretic distances. In the second image, the nodes are arranged in a more linear and structured manner, which better reflects the underlying graph distances, as nodes that are closer in graph-theoretic terms are also closer spatially.

Thus, **Answer 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
