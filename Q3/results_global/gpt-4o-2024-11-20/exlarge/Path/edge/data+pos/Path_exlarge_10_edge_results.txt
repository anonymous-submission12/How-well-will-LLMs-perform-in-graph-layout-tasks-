Determining which graph layout has fewer edge crossings requires calculating the actual number of intersections between edges in each layout based on the given node coordinates and edge data. While I can't directly simulate or count crossings without specific computational methods, I can provide the general approach:

1. For each pair of edges in a layout, check if they intersect.
2. Sum all such intersections.

With the given data, it appears Layout 2 has nodes more evenly distributed along smooth curves (potentially having fewer crossings due to less overlap), while Layout 1 might have nodes scattered more chaotically, potentially increasing crossings. The final count of crossings would need explicit calculation or a computational tool.

Given limited analysis and without computational counting here, **it's likely that Layout 2 has fewer crossings**, based on its structured distribution.
