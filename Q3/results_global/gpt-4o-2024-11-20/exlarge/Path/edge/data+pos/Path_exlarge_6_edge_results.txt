To determine which graph layout has the fewest edge crossings, a computational approach is generally required to count the actual edge crossings between edges in both layouts. However, based on the visual patterns of the coordinates provided:

1. **Answer 1**: The graph layout appears to have more uneven placement of nodes, which may increase the likelihood of edge crossings. Nodes distributed without clear order and clustering can result in more overlaps.

2. **Answer 2**: The graph layout demonstrates a much more sequential flow, likely reducing edge crossings due to its linear-like structure.

Given these observations, **Answer 2** likely has fewer edge crossings because the node placements follow a clearer sequence that minimizes spatial overlap of edges.
