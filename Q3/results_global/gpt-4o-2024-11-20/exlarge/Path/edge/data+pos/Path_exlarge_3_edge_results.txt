To determine which graph layout has fewer edge crossings, a comparison must be conducted based on the positions of the nodes and the interconnecting edges. Edge crossings occur when two edges intersect on the graph plane. Due to the complexity of manually evaluating all edge intersections for the given layouts, one might utilize algorithms or visualization tools to compute the crossings quantitatively.

However, without implementing these computational methods explicitly here, providing an analytical answer based solely on observation of the numerical data is infeasible. Thus, the fewest edge crossings determination requires software simulation using graph visualization and layout tools like Graphviz or Python libraries such as NetworkX.

Given the current format, my system cannot mechanically simulate the layouts to compute crossing counts directly for finite graphs. Therefore, no definitive answer can be provided. Please use computational graph tools for validation.
