To evaluate which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we analyze the geometrical embedding of nodes and assess if spatial distances correspond closely to graph-theoretic distances (shortest path lengths in the graph). Based on the layout provided, **Answer 2** visually arranges the graph in an orderly and circular manner, correlating better with the linear (grid-like) graph structure provided. This indicates that spatial distances in Answer 2 align better with graph-theoretic shortest path distances. Answer 1 appears more scattered and less structured, leading spatial distances to deviate from graph-theoretic distances.
