To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, one can compare the positions of nodes with their shortest-path distances in the graph structure provided. The second layout visually arranges the graph in a smoother pattern resembling a linear or circular graph layout. This layout facilitates the preservation of graph-theoretic distances compared to the more scattered first layout. 

Thus, the second layout (Answer 2) better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
