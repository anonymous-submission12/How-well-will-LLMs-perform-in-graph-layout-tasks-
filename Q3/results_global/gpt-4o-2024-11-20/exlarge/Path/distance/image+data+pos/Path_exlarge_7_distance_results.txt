To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we analyze how closely the Euclidean distance between node pairs corresponds to their graph-theoretic (shortest path) distances in both layouts.

Layout 1 spatially distributes nodes arbitrarily in clusters. This can introduce distortions in graph-theoretic distances by overlapping or clustering unrelated parts of the graph. 

Layout 2 arranges nodes sequentially and more symmetrically, correlating Euclidean and edge connectivity orders to pathways follow preserving exact consistent match grid results traversal distribution optimal lasts.
