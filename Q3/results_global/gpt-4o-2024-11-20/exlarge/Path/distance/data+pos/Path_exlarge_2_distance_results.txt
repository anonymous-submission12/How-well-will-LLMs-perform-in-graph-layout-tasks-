To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to calculate and compare how closely the Euclidean distances between node pairs in each layout correspond to their graph-theoretic distances. Since the input provides data in a custom format, the determination requires direct measurements and comparisons. Based on the data, the second layout ("Layout 2") preserves graph-theoretic distances better because it follows a more sequential and linear spatial arrangement that mimics the chain-like structure of the graph.
