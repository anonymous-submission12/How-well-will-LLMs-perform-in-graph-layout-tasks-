To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to compare the Euclidean distances between node pairs in the provided layouts with their shortest path distances in the graph. Hereâ€™s a summary of the results:

1. **Layout 1**: The preservation of graph-theoretic distances in this layout is better on average. The spatial configuration closely reflects the connectivity and distances in the graph-theoretic sense.
2. **Layout 2**: The layout introduces more distortion in the relative distances compared to the shortest path distances in the graph.
