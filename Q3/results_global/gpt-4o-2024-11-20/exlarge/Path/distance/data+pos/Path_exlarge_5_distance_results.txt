To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the relationship between the Euclidean distances of nodes in the layouts and their graph-theoretic distances. Graph-theoretic distances refer to the number of edges on the shortest path between nodes in the graph.

**Answer 1** gives a graph layout that appears more spaced out with some nodes being closer or further apart non-linearly, which might distort graph-theoretic distances. **Answer 2**, on the other hand, shows a more structured and linear progression of node positions in increments, mimicking graph-theoretic distances more consistently.

Based on the provided coordinates and subgraph structure, **Answer 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distance due to its more consistent mapping of nodes aligned to their positions in the graph.
