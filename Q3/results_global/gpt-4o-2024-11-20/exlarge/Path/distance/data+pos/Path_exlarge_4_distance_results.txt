To determine which graph layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we compare the spatial distances between nodes in each layout to their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path lengths in the graph). The layout that maintains proportions closer to the true graph-theoretic distances is deemed better.

**Analysis**:
1. Layout 1 has more variability in node positioning, which may distort the graph-theoretic distances, especially for longer paths. Observing the coordinate distribution, there is no consistent structure that correlates well with graph-theoretic distance.
2. Layout 2 arranges the nodes in a more linear and sequential manner. The coordinates appear to increase consistently along one dimension (e.g., x-axis), which aligns nearly proportionally to the graph-theoretic distances since the graph is a single path structure.

Given this, **Layout 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distances due to its sequential and uniform placement of nodes.
