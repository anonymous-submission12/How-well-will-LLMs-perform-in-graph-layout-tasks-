To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, one can measure how accurately the Euclidean distances between node coordinates in the layout correspond to the graph-theoretic shortest path distances (computed using the graph data). 

While the exact computation isn't provided here, I can make a qualitative assessment based on the given node coordinates.

1. Layout 1 seems to be more irregular, with nodes spread across a complex distribution pattern. This irregularity may introduce distortions in preserving graph-theoretic relationships.

2. Layout 2 displays a smoother progression in node coordinates, with nodes arranged in a near-linear pattern. This consistency suggests it may better preserve relative graph-theoretic distances.

Given this observation, **Answer 2** appears to be the better choice for preserving graph-theoretic distances.
