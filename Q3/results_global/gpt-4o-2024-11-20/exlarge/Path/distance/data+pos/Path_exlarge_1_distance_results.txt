To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to evaluate how well the Euclidean distances between node pairs in the provided layouts correspond to the graph-theoretic distances given by the shortest paths in the graph. A layout preserving graph-theoretic distance will exhibit closer alignment between these two metrics.

Here's the reasoning:
- The first layout contains several node positions that appear to have overlapping or inconsistent placements relative to their edges, leading to deviations from graph-theoretic distance.
- The second layout features a more visually sequential arrangement corresponding systematically to graph-theoretic distance.

Based on the provided data, **Layout 2** aligns better with graph-theoretic distance.
