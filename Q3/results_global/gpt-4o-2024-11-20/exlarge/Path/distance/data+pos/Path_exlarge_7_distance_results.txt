To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to compare how the spatial distances between node coordinates correlate with the graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances in terms of edge count). After reviewing the two layouts and their node coordinates, here's the result:

  "Answer": 2
}
``` 

Explanation:
Layout 2 positions nodes in a manner that reflects the sequential graph structure more consistently based on their coordinates. Nodes at adjacent graph-theoretic distances have shorter spatial distances, while nodes at greater graph-theoretic distances tend to be more spaced out, ensuring better preservation of graph-theoretic distances compared to Layout 1
