To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, a comparison can be made between geometric distances (Euclidean distances) in each layout and their corresponding graph-theoretic distances.

**Approach**:
1. Compute the graph-theoretic distances between all pairs of nodes from the edge list.
2. Compute the Euclidean distances in both layouts for all pairs of nodes.
3. Compare how closely the Euclidean distances in each layout correlate with the graph-theoretic distances (e.g., using metrics like rank correlation or mean squared error).

**Simplified Analysis**:
By visually inspecting the layouts:
- Layout 1 seems less sequential and more scattered spatially.
- Layout 2 appears more sequential, approximating the linear graph structure.

Typically, layouts resembling the graph's structure (linear in this case) better preserve graph-theoretic distances.
