To determine which graph layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to measure the similarity between the graph-theoretic distances and the spatial distances in each layout. Based on this data:

- **Graph-theoretic distances** depend purely on the shortest-path distances between nodes in the graph.
- **Spatial distances** are the Euclidean distances between coordinates of nodes in the layouts; this requires calculating the Euclidean distance for each edge in the layouts.

### Analysis:
A method such as stress minimization or distance ranking correlation (e.g., Pearson or Spearman coefficients) could be used for precise measurements, but in this case, comparing the given structures visually indicates that:

1. The first layout scatters node positions in such a way that spatial distances between connected nodes in the graph aren't consistently similar to their graph-theoretic distances. Nodes with close graph-theoretic distances appear far apart in the spatial representation, e.g., nodes `(8, 9)` and their surroundings are inconsistently placed relative to their edge connectivity.

2. The second layout maintains more uniform scaling of distances and appears to approximate the graph-theoretic structures more closely. This is particularly visible along linear clusters such as nodes `(0, 1, 2, ..., 75)`, which are consistently spaced proportional to the chain graph.

### Final Answer:
The second layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
