To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the geometric (Euclidean) distances between nodes in each layout with their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances in terms of edges). Without providing the computational details here for brevity, I assess the preservation of graph-theoretic distances for both layouts and conclude that Answer **1** better preserves graph-theoretic distances. Here's the final JSON response:
