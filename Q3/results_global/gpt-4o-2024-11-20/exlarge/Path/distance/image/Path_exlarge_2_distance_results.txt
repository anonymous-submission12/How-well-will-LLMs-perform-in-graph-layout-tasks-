To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we examine how the visual representation reflects the true distances between nodes in the graph. The first layout clusters nodes tightly together, making it harder to distinguish graph-theoretic distances. On the other hand, the second layout spreads nodes more systematically, making paths and distances visually apparent and directly corresponding to graph-theoretic relationships.
