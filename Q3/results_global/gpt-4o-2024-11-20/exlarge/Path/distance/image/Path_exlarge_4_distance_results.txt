To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to evaluate how spatial distances in the layout reflect the topological distances (number of edges) in the graph itself. In the first layout, nodes are dispersed and the graph structure appears less correlated to spatial positioning, leading to significant overlaps and cluttered connections. In contrast, the second layout reveals a more systematic spatial arrangement, where nodes and edges better follow the graph-theoretic distances, as indicated by the separation and grouping of paths.
