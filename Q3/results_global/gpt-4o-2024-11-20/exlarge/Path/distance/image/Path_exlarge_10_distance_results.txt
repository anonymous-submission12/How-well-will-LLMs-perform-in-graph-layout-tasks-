To determine which layout better preserves the graph-theoretic distance, consider how well the distances between nodes in the graph (as defined by shortest-path lengths or edge counts) correspond to their spatial separation in the 2D visualization.

Looking at the two images:

1. **Layout in Answer 1**: This graph is spread out with nodes positioned irregularly, and some edges overlap significantly. It appears less intuitive for preserving graph-theoretic distances due to the more complex crossings and clustering.

2. **Layout in Answer 2**: This graph layout stretches nodes in a more linear and spatially consistent manner. Nodes connected by shorter graph-theoretic paths are closer, and the graph seems to preserve graph-theoretic distances better visually.

Thus, **Answer 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
