To determine which graph layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we aim to assess how spatial distance between nodes in the image correlates with their shortest path distance in the graph. Here is the analysis:

**Layout 1**:
- This layout appears to use a force-directed algorithm where nodes repel each other and edges act as springs. Nodes are distributed somewhat uniformly, and there is substantial overlap of edges.
- Graph-theoretic distances are harder to visually estimate due to edge crossings and dense clustering in certain areas.

**Layout 2**:
- This layout seems more linear and structured, forming clear clusters and loops. It visually spreads out nodes in a way that appears to align with the graph's structure.
- Shortest path distances between nodes seem to be more faithfully represented in terms of spatial proximity, with fewer overlapping edges.

**Conclusion**:
Layout 2 better preserves graph-theoretic distances, as the spatial arrangement aligns more closely with the graph's structure, making the visualization of shortest paths clearer and easier to interpret.
