To determine which graph layout has fewer edge crossings, all edge intersections must be checked based on the provided node coordinates for both layouts. Due to the complexity of graph geometry calculations, this determination typically requires computational graph analysis software. Without computation power or visual representation of crossings, it's impractical to give a definitive answer manually. For accurate results, analyze the layouts using specialized graph visualization tools.

However, based on the JSON field request format:
