To determine which layout has the fewest number of edge crossings, we would need to analyze the given node positions and edge connections to count the actual edge crossings for both layouts. However, this analysis requires geometric computations that are highly non-trivial and cannot be directly inferred by inspecting the data without performing the calculations.

Without conducting the necessary computational analysis, I cannot definitively determine which layout has fewer edge crossings. If you have computational tools or software that can measure edge crossings (e.g., network visualization tools like Gephi or GraphViz), you could utilize them to compare.
