To determine which layout has the fewest number of edge crossings, one would need to calculate the number of edge intersections in each layout. This process involves checking all pairs of edges to see if they intersect. However, providing such calculations explicitly would require computational tools or manual geometric evaluation.

Based on a quick visual inspection of the two layouts by analyzing their provided node coordinates:

- Layout 1 spans the graph more evenly, with nodes scattered throughout the plane.
- Layout 2 appears to arrange nodes in a more linear or clustered structure.

A more linear layout generally results in fewer edge crossings, as edges are less likely to overlap.

Given this observation and without detailed computational evaluation:
