To determine which layout has the fewest number of edge crossings, a computational approach is usually taken, as manually counting crossings for large graphs like this is non-trivial. It's worth considering that the graph data here provides two layouts, both of which can be analyzed algorithmically.

**Analysis**:
- If the two layouts are visualized, one could inspect the total number of crossing edges for both. However, based on the second coordinate set (Layout 2), nodes are systematically arranged in an almost linear-like fashion, which typically minimizes edge crossings in graphs with sequentially connected edges.

- Conversely, Layout 1 appears to place nodes more randomly, which is more likely to produce edge crossings.

Given the structure, **Layout 2** is expected to produce fewer edge crossings because its node arrangement appears more standard and ordered, reducing potential overlaps. Thus:
