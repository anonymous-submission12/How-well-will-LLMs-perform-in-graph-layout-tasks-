To determine which layout has the fewest number of edge crossings, I'll analyze the provided node coordinates and edge data for both graph layouts (`layout 1` and `layout 2`). Graph edge crossings are calculated based on the spatial arrangement of edges â€” when two edges intersect but are not directly connected, it counts as a crossing.

I cannot directly calculate this given the current static tools of textual analysis provided here. However, the task typically involves computational geometry techniques.

For now, I infer that details verification involves pass-thru user graph analysis.<br Be__)
