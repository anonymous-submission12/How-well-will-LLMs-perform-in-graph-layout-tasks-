To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, the following observations can be made:

1. **Definition of Graph-Theoretic Distance Preservation**: This refers to how well the spatial distance in the layout corresponds to the shortest path distances in the graph. Nodes that are close in terms of graph topology should also be close in the layout, and graph-theoretically distant nodes should be reasonably separated.

2. **Visual Analysis**:
   - **Image 1**: The node placements appear dispersed and do not maintain an explicit relationship to the sequential nature of the graph structure provided in the data. Interconnected nodes are scattered spatially.
   - **Image 2**: The layout forms an organized structure that visually corresponds more closely to the sequential and topological structure of the graph. The circular and linear patterns reflect the graphâ€™s edge connectivity better, ensuring graph-theoretic distances are preserved more intuitively.

3. **JSON Data Analysis**:
   - Comparing the node coordinates for both layouts, the coordinates in **Image 2** follow a consistent progression, avoiding abrupt jumps which would misrepresent graph distances. In contrast, the coordinates in **Image 1** are more scattered.

### Conclusion:
From both the visual and numerical analysis, **Image 2's layout preserves graph-theoretic distances better**.
