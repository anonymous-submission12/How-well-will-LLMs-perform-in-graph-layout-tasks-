To determine which layout better preserves the graph-theoretic distances, we need to analyze the geometric distances between nodes in each layout relative to their shortest path distances in the graph.

In Layout 2, the nodes appear to form coherent groupings representing proximity in terms of graph-theoretic distances (e.g., nodes connected closely in the graph are also placed geometrically closer). This layout maintains a more circular and structured positioning, indicative of preserved neighborhood relationships.

In Layout 1, distances and neighborhood relationships seem less preserved. Nodes are spread out more arbitrarily, making it harder to visually infer the graph-theoretic distances between nodes.

Hence, **Layout 2 better preserves graph-theoretic distances.**
