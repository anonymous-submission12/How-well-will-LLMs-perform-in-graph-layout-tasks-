To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to analyze the position of nodes based on their distances in the graph (how many hops are required to traverse the graph connecting any two nodes) and compare that to their geometric distances in the layouts.

**Answer 2** appears to follow a more circular or linear arrangement, wherein nodes that are directly connected geometrically seem closer, correlating better with graph-theoretic distances (topological distances). This visual arrangement suggests a stronger preservation of distances in the graph data. On the other hand, **Answer 1** seems spatially more scattered and less structured to align geometric distance with topological distance.

Both layouts could be analyzed numerically (e.g., using stress minimization or multidimensional scaling metrics), but based on visual observation, **Answer 2** better reflects graph-theoretic distance.
