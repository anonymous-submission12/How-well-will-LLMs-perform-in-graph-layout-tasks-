To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we can observe the structure and spread of the nodes in both images. In the first layout:
- Nodes are scattered and intertwined, making the graph less visually representative of the sequence or ordering of nodes along the graph structure.

In the second layout:
- Nodes are arranged in sequence and are clearly spaced in a manner that represents the linear or cyclic nature of the graph-theoretic relationships. Adjacent nodes in the graph are positioned closer, preserving the overall distances more effectively.

Thus, **layout 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distances.
