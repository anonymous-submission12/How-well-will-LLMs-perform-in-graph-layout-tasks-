To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we examine how closely the spatial distances between node coordinates in the layout correspond to the graph-theoretic distances (shortest path lengths in the graph). Layout 2 follows an almost circular or linear structure, which matches the sequential nature of the graph data, thereby preserving graph-theoretic distances better than Layout 1, which appears more scattered and irregular.
