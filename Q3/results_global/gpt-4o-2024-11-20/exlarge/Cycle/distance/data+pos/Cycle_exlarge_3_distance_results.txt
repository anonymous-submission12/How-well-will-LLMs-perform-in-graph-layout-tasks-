To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we evaluate how well the Euclidean distance between the coordinates in a layout represents the graph-theoretic (shortest-path) distances in the graph. The analysis is complex but can be approximated numerically. In this case, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distances because it displays a more linear topological alignment and consistent scaling between the nodes with respect to the graph structure.
