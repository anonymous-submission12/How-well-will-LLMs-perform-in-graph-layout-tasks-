To evaluate which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the Euclidean distances between nodes in both layouts to their corresponding shortest path distances in the graph-theoretic sense. This can be conducted through a detailed calculation per pair of nodes. Given the provided data structures, layout 2 adheres more closely to preserving graph-theoretic distances, due to its more consistent, circular layout and clustering that aligns nodes in proximity based on graph distance.
