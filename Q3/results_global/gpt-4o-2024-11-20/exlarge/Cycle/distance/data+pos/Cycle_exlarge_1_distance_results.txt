To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we will compare the Euclidean distances in the layouts to the shortest path distances in the graph data and calculate the deviation from the original graph-theoretic distances. The layout that results in smaller deviations overall better preserves graph-theoretic distances.

Here is the final answer based on computations:
