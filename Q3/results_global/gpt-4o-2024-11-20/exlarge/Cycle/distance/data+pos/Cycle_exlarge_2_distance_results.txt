To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout with their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances in the graph). The layout that has a closer correspondence between these distances better preserves graph-theoretic distance.

After analyzing the two layouts, **Layout 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distance because its node coordinates are more uniformly distributed along the graph's structure, resulting in a closer match between Euclidean and graph-theoretic distances.
