To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout with their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances in the graph). The layout that has a closer correspondence between these two measures is the better choice.

After analyzing the data:

- **Layout 1**: The node coordinates are spread out in a way that does not consistently reflect the graph-theoretic distances. For example, nodes that are close in graph-theoretic terms may appear far apart in Euclidean space.
- **Layout 2**: The node coordinates follow a more linear progression, which aligns better with the graph-theoretic distances. Nodes that are adjacent in the graph tend to have closer Euclidean distances.

Thus, **Layout 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
