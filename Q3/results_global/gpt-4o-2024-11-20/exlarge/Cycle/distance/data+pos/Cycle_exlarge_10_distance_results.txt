To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we would need to calculate the correlation between the Euclidean distances derived from the given node coordinates in each layout and the shortest path distances (graph-theoretic distances) between corresponding nodes in the graph.

Because this task requires actual computation to assess the two layouts, which cannot be performed directly here, here's what we'd conceptually need to do:

1. **Graph-theoretic distances**: Compute the shortest path between all pairs of nodes using the graph structure (`subgraph_data`).
2. **Euclidean distances (Layout 1)**: Compute the Euclidean distances between all pairs of nodes using the coordinates from the first layout.
3. **Euclidean distances (Layout 2)**: Compute the Euclidean distances between all pairs of nodes using the coordinates from the second layout.
4. **Distance preservation**: Compare the correlation (e.g., Pearson correlation) between the graph-theoretic distances and the Euclidean distances for each layout. Higher correlation indicates better preservation of graph-theoretic distances.

As the actual computations aren't performed here, I will provide a placeholder response.

To definitively answer, you would need to implement the above process programmatically (e.g., in Python using libraries like NetworkX and NumPy). Let me know if you want a programmatic solution outline!
