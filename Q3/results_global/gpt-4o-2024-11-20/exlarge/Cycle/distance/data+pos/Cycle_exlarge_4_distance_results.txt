To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout with their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances in the graph). The layout that has a closer correspondence between these distances better preserves graph-theoretic distance.

After analyzing the data:

- **Layout 1** has node coordinates that are more spread out and irregular, leading to less consistent preservation of graph-theoretic distances.
- **Layout 2** has node coordinates that follow a smoother progression, which aligns better with the graph-theoretic distances.

Thus, **Layout 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
