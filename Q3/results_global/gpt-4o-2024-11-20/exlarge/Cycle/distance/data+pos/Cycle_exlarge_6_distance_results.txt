To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout with their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances based on the graph structure). The layout that has Euclidean distances more closely matching the graph-theoretic distances is the better choice.

After analyzing the data, **Layout 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distances. This is because the node coordinates in Layout 2 are arranged in a more linear and consistent manner, reflecting the sequential nature of the graph structure.
