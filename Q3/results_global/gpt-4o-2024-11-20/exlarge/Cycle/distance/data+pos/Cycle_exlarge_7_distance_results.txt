To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout with their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances in the graph). The layout that has a closer correspondence between these distances better preserves graph-theoretic distance.

After analyzing the data:

- **Layout 1** has more irregularities in the correspondence between Euclidean and graph-theoretic distances, especially for nodes that are farther apart in the graph.
- **Layout 2** shows a more consistent mapping of graph-theoretic distances to Euclidean distances, with nodes that are closer in the graph also being closer in the layout.

Thus, **Layout 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
