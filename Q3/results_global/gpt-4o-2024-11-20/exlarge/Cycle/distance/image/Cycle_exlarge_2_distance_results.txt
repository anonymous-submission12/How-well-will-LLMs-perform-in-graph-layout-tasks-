Based on the visual assessment of the two layouts, **Answer 2** appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In Answer 2, nodes and edges are arranged in a manner that reflects the relative distances and connectivity seen in the graph structure more clearly. Nodes that are connected tend to be closer together spatially, and distant nodes are placed further apart, which adheres more closely to graph-theoretic distances.
