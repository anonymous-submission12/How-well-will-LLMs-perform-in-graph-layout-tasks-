To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we observe how the distance between nodes in the visualization corresponds to the actual shortest path distance in the graph. Based on the images provided:

1. **Image 1**: The graph layout appears disorganized, with nodes densely clustered and overlapping edges. It is difficult to visually correlate spatial distances between nodes with their graph-theoretic distances.

2. **Image 2**: The graph layout is clearer, with nodes arranged neatly and consistent spacing. The geometric distances in the layout more closely align with the graph-theoretic distances, making it easier to interpret relationships and distances.

**Final Decision**: The second layout (Image 2) better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
