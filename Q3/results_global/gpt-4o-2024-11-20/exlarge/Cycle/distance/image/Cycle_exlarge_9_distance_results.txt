To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we typically look for how accurately the spatial distance between nodes reflects their true distances along edges in the graph.

Layout 2 appears to provide a clearer preservation of graph-theoretic distance, as nodes that are closer in terms of graph edges are also visually closer spatially in the layout. Additionally, Layout 2 minimizes overlapping edges and ensures a more planar representation of the graph.
