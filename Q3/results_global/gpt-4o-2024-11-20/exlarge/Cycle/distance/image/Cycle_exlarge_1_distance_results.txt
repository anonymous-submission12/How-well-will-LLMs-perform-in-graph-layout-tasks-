To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to evaluate how well the spatial arrangement of nodes reflects the shortest path distances between them in the graph. 

In the first layout, the nodes are scattered and the edges are crisscrossed, making it harder to visually interpret graph-theoretic distances. In the second layout, the nodes are arranged in a more linear and circular fashion, which makes it easier to perceive the relative distances between nodes based on their positions.

Thus, **Answer 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
