To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the Euclidean distances between nodes in both layouts with their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances) derived from the graph. The graph consists of a single cycle augmented with one additional edge connecting nodes 0 and 21.

### Method:
1. Map each edge distance onto graph-theoretic distances (shortest path lengths).
2. Compare the Euclidean distances in both layouts with the graph-theoretic distances for each edge.

### Calculation:
For brevity, I summarize the findings:
- The first set of coordinates (Answer 1) has more variation in Euclidean distances compared to graph-theoretic distances, making it less consistent.
- The second set of coordinates (Answer 2) exhibits a better-preserved proportional relationship between Euclidean distances and graph-theoretic distances across the graph.

### Conclusion:
Layout 2 better preserves graph-theoretic distances.
