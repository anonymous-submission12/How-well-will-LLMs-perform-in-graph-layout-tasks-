To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, one would compare the Euclidean distances between the coordinates of nodes in each layout with the shortest path distances between those nodes in the graph. A layout that more accurately reflects the graph's shortest path distances is the better layout. The task involves quantitative calculation for all pairs of nodes.

Let's consider the steps involved:

1. **Graph-theoretic distances**: Calculate the shortest path (number of edges) between all pairs of nodes in the graph.
2. **Euclidean distances**: Compute the Euclidean distance between the coordinates of all pairs of nodes in each layout.
3. **Accuracy comparison**: Evaluate how close the Euclidean distances in each layout are to the graph-theoretic distances.

After analysis, here's the result:

Layout 1 generally better represents the graph-theoretic distances.
