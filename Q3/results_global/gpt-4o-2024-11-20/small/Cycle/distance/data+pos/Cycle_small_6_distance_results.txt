To evaluate which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distance between nodes in each layout correlates with the graph-theoretic distance (shortest path distance) in the graph. 

Given the node coordinates for both layouts, we calculate the Euclidean distance between all pairs of nodes in each layout and compare these distances to their respective graph-theoretic distances.

After performing computational analyses:

**Answer 1:** The first layout preserves graph-theoretic distances better than Answer 2. It results in closer adherence between the actual graph distances and computed Euclidean distances, minimizing distortion.

Here is the final answer:
