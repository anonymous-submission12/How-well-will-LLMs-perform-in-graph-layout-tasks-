To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we analyze how well the Euclidean distances between node coordinates in each layout preserve the shortest-path distances derived from the graph. This involves comparing spatial proximity in each layout to graph-theoretic distances between nodes.

Now, comparing both representations:

1. **Answer 1** generates node coordinates that appear less structured along a clear graph-theoretic progression. Some nodes' positions (especially nodes like `27`) are considerably offset, not reflecting their relative graph distances accurately.

2. **Answer 2**, on the other hand, arranges nodes in a coordinated manner where positions follow the graph's distance hierarchy and general progression. This layout demonstrates a smoother distribution consistent with graph-theoretic distances and relationships between nodes.

Thus, **Answer 2** better preserves the graph-theoretic distance.
