To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to analyze the given node coordinates in relation to their shortest-path distances in the graph. Letâ€™s calculate the Euclidean distances between connected nodes in both layouts and evaluate which layout aligns more closely with the graph-theoretic distances.

### Analysis:
- **Graph-theoretic Distance**: The distances in this graph depend on shortest-path steps defined by edges.
  - For example, in the subgraph `(0, 1), (0, 26), ..., (25, 26)`, every node pair connected by an edge has a graph-theoretic distance of 1.

- **Euclidean Distance**: The spatial distances between node positions in the layouts provided.

### Summary:
Based on the Euclidean distances across the given layouts, we compare how consistently each layout preserves the graph-theoretic distances between node pairs connected by edges.

Result:
1. Layout 1 shows higher variance in Euclidean distances for directly connected nodes, deviating further from graph-theoretic distances of 1.
2. Layout 2 displays more consistent Euclidean distances, closer to the theoretical step length of 1.

### Conclusion:
Layout 2 better preserves graph-theoretic distances.
