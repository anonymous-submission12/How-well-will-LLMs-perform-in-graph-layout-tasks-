To evaluate which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, I will compute the Euclidean distances in both layouts for some sampled pairs of connected nodes and compare those against the graph-theoretic distances (number of edges via shortest paths). The layout that consistently has Euclidean distances proportional to graph-theoretic distances is considered better for preserving them.

1. **Analysis for Layout 1**:
   - Use the first set of node coordinates (`{'0': [0.91, -0.03], '1': [0.56, -0.0], ...}`).
   - For adjacent nodes (e.g., `(0,1)`), calculate Euclidean distances and compare them against what would be proportional to the count.
