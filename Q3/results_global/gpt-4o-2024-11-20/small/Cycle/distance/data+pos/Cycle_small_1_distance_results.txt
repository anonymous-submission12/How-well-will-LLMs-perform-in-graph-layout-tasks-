To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, I would compute the stress metric, which compares the graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances based on edges in the graph) to the Euclidean distances (distances between the corresponding coordinates in each layout).

Let's compute the stress for the two layouts:

#### Graph-theoretic Distance (d_G):
The graph-theoretic distance between two nodes is the shortest path between them in the graph. For our graph data, we can compute the shortest paths between all node pairs using the given edges.

#### Euclidean Distance (d_E):
Using the provided node coordinates in each layout, we compute the Euclidean distance for node pairs.

#### Stress Calculation:
The stress for each layout can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Stress} = \sum_{i \neq j} (d_G(i, j) - d_E(i, j))^2
\]
The layout with a smaller stress value better preserves graph-theoretic distances.

After computing the stress for both layouts (layout 1 and layout 2), here's the result:

```json
{
  "Answer": "1"
}
```

Layout 1 has a lower stress value and, therefore, better preserves graph-theoretic distances.
