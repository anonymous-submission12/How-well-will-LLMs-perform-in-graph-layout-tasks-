To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to evaluate how well the spatial distances (Euclidean distances based on node coordinates) in each layout correlate with the shortest path distances in the graph-theoretic representation. For brevity, I'll summarize:

1. **Shortest Path Calculation:** Use the graph edges to compute the shortest path (Hop count) distances between nodes.
2. **Euclidean Distance Computation:** Calculate the Euclidean distances between nodes based on their coordinates for each layout.
3. **Correlation Measure:** Compare the correlation or discrepancy between graph-theoretic distances and Euclidean distances for both layouts.

While I cannot directly compute these values in this context, I can reason conceptually:
- Based on the subgraph data, Layout 2 appears more evenly spaced and aligned to a clear progression, which may better reflect graph-theoretic distances.

Thus, I suspect Layout 2 might better preserve distances.
