To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout with their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances in the graph). The layout that has a closer correspondence between these two measures is the better choice.

### Analysis:
1. **Graph Data**:
   - The graph is a cycle with 24 nodes, where each node is connected to its two neighbors.

2. **Layouts**:
   - **Layout 1**: Node coordinates are given in the first dictionary.
   - **Layout 2**: Node coordinates are given in the second dictionary.

3. **Method**:
   - Compute the graph-theoretic distance (shortest path distance) between all pairs of nodes.
   - Compute the Euclidean distance between all pairs of nodes for each layout.
   - Compare the correlation or similarity between graph-theoretic distances and Euclidean distances for both layouts.

### Observations:
After analyzing the data, **Layout 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distances. This is because the nodes are arranged in a more circular pattern, which aligns with the structure of the graph (a cycle). In contrast, **Layout 1** has a more scattered arrangement, leading to less correspondence between graph-theoretic and Euclidean distances.
