To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, one can measure how closely the Euclidean distances between nodes in the layout approximate the shortest path distances in the graph (graph-theoretic distances). Layout 2 arranges nodes in such a way that connections more directly reflect their graph-theoretical distances (e.g., nodes along the graph's cycle are spaced proportionately and consistently).

Based on qualitative observation:

Layout 1 places nodes such that their Euclidean distances do not clearly correlate with graph-theoretic distances, as many interacting connections make the visualization tangled. In contrast, Layout 2 arranges the nodes in a smooth circular or spaced manner that better approximates the shortest path distances.
