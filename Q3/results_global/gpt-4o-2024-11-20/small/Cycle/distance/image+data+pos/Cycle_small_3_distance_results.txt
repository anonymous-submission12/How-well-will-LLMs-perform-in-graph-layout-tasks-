To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we compare how the Euclidean distances between nodes in the layout correlate to their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path lengths).

### Observations:
1. In Layout 1, nodes are positioned in a way that does not consistently reflect their graph-theoretic distances. For example, nodes connected or close in graph-theoretic terms often appear far away in the Euclidean space.
2. In Layout 2, nodes are arranged along what seems to be a circular structure, which more directly reflects the graph-theoretic distances. Consecutive nodes are close in Euclidean space, matching their closeness in the graph structure.

### Conclusion:
Layout 2 better preserves graph-theoretic distances compared to Layout 1.
