To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to evaluate the geometric distance between nodes in each layout relative to their graph-theoretic distance. Graph-theoretic distance is the minimum number of edges required to travel between two nodes in the graph.

Layout 2 forms a more uniform distribution of nodes along their respective edges, making the geometric distances between neighboring nodes more consistent and proportional to their graph-theoretic distances compared to Layout 1. Layout 1 distorts certain relationships, as the node placement is less uniformly spaced and appears visually compressed or stretched in parts.
