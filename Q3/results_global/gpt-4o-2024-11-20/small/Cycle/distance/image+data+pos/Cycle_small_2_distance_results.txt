To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we compare whether the Euclidean distance between node pairs in each layout reflects the graph distance (number of edges between nodes).

### Observation:
1. **Image 1:** The graph's node coordinates are spread out without clear adherence to the graph's sequential structure. Nodes that are close in graph topology (e.g., neighbors like `(1, 2)`) do not appear as close in Euclidean distance.
2. **Image 2:** The graph has been arranged into a loop preserving the sequential structure, where nodes close in graph topology are also nearly equidistant in Euclidean space. This layout better reflects graph-theoretic distances.

### Conclusion:
**Answer 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
