To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we analyze how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in the coordinate space correlate with their shortest path distances (graph-theoretic distances) based on connectivity in the graph data.

For **Layout 1**, the nodes are distributed in a more irregular pattern, causing shorter Euclidean distances between long graph-theoretic paths because nodes that are graph-theoretically distant are placed closer to each other spatially.

For **Layout 2**, nodes appear to be arranged more systematically. The layout visually follows the graph's sequential structure, with consistent spacing between neighbors. This means that the Euclidean distances more closely align with the graph-theoretic distances.

### Conclusion
By observation, **Layout 2 better preserves the graph-theoretic distances**. The systematic arrangement of nodes makes the spatial relationships between neighboring nodes more representative of the graph structure.
