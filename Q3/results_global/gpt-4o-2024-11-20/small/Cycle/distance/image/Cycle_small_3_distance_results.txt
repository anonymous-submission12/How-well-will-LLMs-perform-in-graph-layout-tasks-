To evaluate which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we consider how the spatial position of nodes reflects their shortest-path distances in the graph. Answer 2 shows a circular layout where distances between nodes on the graph (edges) appear to correspond to their geometric distances more consistently, while Answer 1 seems scattered, making it harder to visually capture accurate graph-theoretic distances.
