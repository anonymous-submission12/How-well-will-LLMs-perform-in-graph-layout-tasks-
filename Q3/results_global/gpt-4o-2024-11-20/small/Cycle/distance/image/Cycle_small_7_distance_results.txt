To determine which graph layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, one must examine the relationship between the positions of nodes in the layout and their shortest-path distances in the graph topology. 

The first image (Answer 1) has nodes scattered more randomly, and the distances between nodes in the layout may not correspond well to graph-theoretic distances. 

The second image (Answer 2) organizes nodes in a more circular or linear fashion, where the layout appears to respect the graph-theoretic distances better. Nodes that are close in terms of connectivity in the graph are positioned closer together in the layout, and distances are consistently followed.

The better preservation of graph-theoretic distances can be observed in **Answer 2**.
