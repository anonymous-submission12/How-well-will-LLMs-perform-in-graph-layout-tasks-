To determine which layout has the fewest number of edge crossings, we need to analyze the positions of the nodes and the edges connecting them. Edge crossings occur when two edges intersect in the graph layout.

### Analysis:
1. **Layout 1**:
   - Node coordinates: `{'0': [0.8, 0.54], '1': [0.52, 0.78], '22': [0.64, 0.23], ...}`
   - Edge data: `[(0, 1), (0, 22), (1, 2), (2, 3), ...]`
   - The nodes are distributed in a more scattered manner, with some edges potentially crossing due to proximity and overlapping paths.

2. **Layout 2**:
   - Node coordinates: `{'0': [-0.26, 1.0], '1': [-0.47, 0.91], '22': [-0.04, 0.97], ...}`
   - Edge data: `[(0, 1), (0, 22), (1, 2), (2, 3), ...]`
   - The nodes are arranged in a more linear or circular pattern, reducing the likelihood of edge crossings.

### Conclusion:
Based on the node distributions and edge connections, **Layout 2** appears to have fewer edge crossings due to its more structured arrangement of nodes.
