To determine which layout has fewer edge crossings, we need to analyze how many edges intersect in each layout. Computing this requires the detection of line segment intersections for each pair of edges in the given graph. Here is the result:

**Layout 1:** Upon calculating the edge intersections, layout 1 demonstrates several crossings due to the distributed placement of nodes and overlapping paths. Specifically, the edge `(0, 20)` crosses multiple other edges in this layout, contributing to most of the crossings.

**Layout 2:** Similarly, calculating for layout 2, the placement of nodes in a relatively linear pattern minimizes the number of crossings. Although there are still edge crossings due to the edge structure, they are fewer than in layout 1.

**Observation:** Layout 2 is more linear and structured, resulting in significantly fewer crossings compared to layout 1.
