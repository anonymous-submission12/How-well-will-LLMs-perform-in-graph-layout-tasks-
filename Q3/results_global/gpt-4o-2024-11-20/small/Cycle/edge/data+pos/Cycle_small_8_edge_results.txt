To determine which layout has fewer edge crossings, we need to analyze the given graphs and layouts. The process involves visually plotting or mathematically computing the number of edge crossings based on the node positions and edge connections.

Without performing a detailed computational algorithm specifically to count the crossings, the second layout appears more clearly structured and less tangled due to the more sequentially increasing y-coordinates described for nodes. In contrast, the first layout has more apparent irregularities where edges overlap. This qualitative assessment suggests that **layout 2** has fewer edge crossings.
