To determine which layout has fewer edge crossings, we need to count the number of times edges intersect in each layout based on the node coordinates provided. Due to the complexity of calculating edge crossings directly from textual input without a programmatic analysis, a concrete number cannot be derived without computational geometry operations. However, if specified to provide an answer solely based on observed patterns and relative compactness:

**Analysis**:
Layout 2 arranges most nodes in a roughly sequential, circular topology, which minimizes crossings by reducing the likelihood of non-adjacent edges crossing. Meanwhile
