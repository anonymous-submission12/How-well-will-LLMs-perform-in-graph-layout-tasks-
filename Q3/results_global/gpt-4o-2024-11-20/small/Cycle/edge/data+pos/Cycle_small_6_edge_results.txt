To determine which layout has the fewest edge crossings, the positions of nodes in each layout are analyzed to see where edges might intersect. This typically involves computational geometry algorithms that calculate intersection points. Since computational processing or visualization of the given layouts isn't possible directly from this static data, we'll assess and compute edge crossings mathematically.
