To determine which graph layout has the fewest edge crossings, we visually inspect the images provided:

1. **Layout 1**: The graph has multiple edge crossings, particularly in the central region where edges overlap significantly.
2. **Layout 2**: The graph appears to have no edge crossings, as the edges are arranged in a circular or loop-like manner without overlapping.

Based on this observation, **Layout 2** has fewer edge crossings.
