To determine which graph layout has the fewest number of edge crossings:

Layout 1 (first image) clearly has multiple edges that cross each other visibly, due to its tangled structure.

Layout 2 (second image) appears to have no edge crossings, as the edges are laid out in a cleaner and simpler structure.

Thus, **Layout 2** has the fewest number of edge crossings.
