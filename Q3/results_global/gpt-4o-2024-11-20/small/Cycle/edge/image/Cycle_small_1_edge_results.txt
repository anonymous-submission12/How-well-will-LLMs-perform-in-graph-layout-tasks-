To determine which graph layout has the fewest edge crossings, we visually inspect the images:

- **Image 1**: Contains multiple edge crossings where lines intersect.
- **Image 2**: Appears to have no edge crossings, as all edges are drawn without intersecting.

Thus, **Image 2** has fewer edge crossings.
