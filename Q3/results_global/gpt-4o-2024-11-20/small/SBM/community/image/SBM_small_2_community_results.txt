To determine which layout keeps the community structure visually clearer, observe the graphs:

- **Answer 1**: Nodes are spread out, but communities are not visually distinct. The arrangement produces overlapping regions, making it harder to separate clusters or communities at a glance.

- **Answer 2**: Nodes are arranged to clearly delineate community structures with less overlap between groups. The communities are visually distinct due to spatial separation.

Answer 2 keeps the community structure visually clearer.
