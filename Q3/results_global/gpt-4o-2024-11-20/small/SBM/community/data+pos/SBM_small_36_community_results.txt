To determine which graph layout keeps the community structure visually clearer, we analyze the spatial distribution of the nodes and their grouping relative to the edges. Community structure typically appears as clusters of tightly connected nodes that are visually separated from other clusters.

1. **Layout 1 Analysis:**
   - Nodes appear to form distinct spatial clusters, especially with the grouping of nodes like `8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15` and another group with nodes such as `0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 19`.
   - There is less overlap between different groups, making the divisions between communities visually clearer.

2. **Layout 2 Analysis:**
   - Nodes are distributed somewhat uniformly without clear spatial distinction between clusters.
   - Communities appear to overlap more, resulting in less clarity of the community structure.

**Conclusion: Layout 1 better preserves the community structure visually.**
