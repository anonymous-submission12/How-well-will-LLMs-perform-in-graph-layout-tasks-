To determine which layout preserves the community structure visually better, we analyze how nodes belonging to specific communities cluster spatially and whether their connections remain visually coherent.

**Answer 1 Layout**:
- Nodes such as '0', '2', '3', '4', '5', etc., which form one community, are positioned relatively close to one another.
- Nodes '21', '20', '22', '23', etc., which appear connected as another community, maintain distinctive clustering.
- Nodes '10', '11', '12', etc., forming a third weakly overlapping community, are grouped together spatially and distinct from others.

**Answer 2 Layout**:
- The clustering of '0', '2', '3', and other nodes of the first community spreads more horizontally, making it harder to visually distinguish connections within the community.
- Nodes '21', '20', '22', '23', etc., of the second community are positioned vertically, leading to overlaps among other groups that reduce clarity of the network structure.
- Nodes '10', '11', '12', and similar behave are less compact-subspacehouse..
