To determine which layout preserves the community structure more clearly, we analyze the given graph data with node coordinates. A clearer community structure typically manifests as clusters of nodes that are visually distinct and closely packed together.

**Analysis:**
- The first layout (`{'0': [-0.26, -0.17], ...}`) shows groups of nodes organized with clear proximity in coordinates. For example:
  1. Nodes `7`, `8`, `10`, `11`, `12`, and `13` form a tightly-knit cluster.
  2. Nodes `14`, `15`, `16`, `17`, `18`, `19`, and `20` seem to cluster separately.
  3. Nodes `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6` create another distinct group.

- The second layout (`{'0': [0.11, 0.2], ...}`) appears more scattered, with less clear community structure. For instance:
  1. Nodes meant to be in close proximity (e.g., `14`, `15`, `16`, `17`, `18`, `19`, and `20`) are spread across different regions.
  2. Nodes `7`, `8`, `10`, `11`, `12`, and `13` do not form a cohesive cluster but are spread out.
  3. Nodes `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6` are not tightly packed and appear less distinct as a group.

Based on this analysis, it is evident that **Answer 1** preserves the community structure more clearly.
