To determine which graph layout keeps the community structure visually clearer, we analyze the node coordinates and their distribution across the graph. Graph layouts that cluster nodes within the same community closer together typically provide a clearer representation of community structure.

### Analysis:

1. **First Layout:** Nodes that seem to belong to distinct groups (e.g., communities) are clustered spatially, like nodes `8, 11, 13, 23` in one area and nodes `0, 3, 4, 6` clustered together. This layout suggests some clear separations between communities due to spatial clustering.

2. **Second Layout:** Node placement appears more scattered, and potential communities seem less distinctly separated. For instance, nodes such as `8, 11, 13, 10` are not tightly clustered, and the overall layout looks less conducive to clearly visualizing community structures.

### Conclusion:
The first layout maintains community structure more clearly.
