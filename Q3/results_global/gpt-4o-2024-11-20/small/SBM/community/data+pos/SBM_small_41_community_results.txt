To determine which graph layout preserves the community structure visually clearer, we consider how well the nodes within each community are clustered together and how distinct different communities are. 

1. **Answer 1**: In the first layout, the nodes within specific communities (e.g., nodes associated through denser connections) appear spatially tighter and distinct. Notably, nodes like (18, 19, 22) cluster in a group on one side, while others like (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.) cluster separately. This layout separates communities more clearly.

2. **Answer 2**: In the second layout, the nodes are more evenly distributed over the entire space, leading to overlapping communities. For example, nodes from different communities are mixed closer together, making it harder to discern distinct groups.

Thus, **Answer 1** better preserves the visual clarity of the community structure.
