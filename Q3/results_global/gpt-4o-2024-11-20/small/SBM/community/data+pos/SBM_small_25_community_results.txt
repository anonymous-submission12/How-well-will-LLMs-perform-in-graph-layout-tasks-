To determine which layout keeps the community structure visually clearer, we analyze the spatial grouping of nodes representing probable communities based on connectivity from the input data. 

Layout 1 groups nodes into three visually distinct clusters:
- Nodes 0-6 form one cluster.
- Nodes 7-13 form another.
- Nodes 14-20 form the third.

Layout 2 spreads nodes more evenly across the space, resulting in less visually distinct clustering.

### Final Answer: **Layout 1** keeps the community structure visually clearer.
