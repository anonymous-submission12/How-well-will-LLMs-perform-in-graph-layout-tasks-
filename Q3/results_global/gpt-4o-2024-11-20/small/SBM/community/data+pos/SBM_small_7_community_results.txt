To determine which layout keeps the community structure visually clearer, let us examine how well each layout separates the different communities in the graph.

1. **Graph Description**: 
   - The graph consists of a dense cluster of nodes (0–6), a separate dense cluster (7–13), and another cluster (14–20).
   - Good layouts should visually separate these clusters to maintain a clear community structure.

2. **Analysis of Layout 1 (`Answer 1`):**
   - Nodes `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}` (Community 1) are mostly clustered in the top-left area.
   - Nodes `{7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}` (Community 2) are separated toward the right side.
   - Nodes `{14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}` (Community 3) are distinct in the bottom-left.
   - This layout visually separates the communities effectively.

3. **Analysis of Layout 2 (`Answer 2`):**
   - In this layout, the nodes of Community 1 (`0-6`) and Community 3 (`14-20`) are less distinctly grouped. There is some mixing of nodes between communities, which makes it less apparent where one community ends and another begins.
   - Community 2 (`7-13`) is separated but not as distinctly as in Layout 1.

**Conclusion**: Layout 1 (`Answer 1`) preserves the community structure more clearly because the different clusters are better separated visually compared to Layout 2.
