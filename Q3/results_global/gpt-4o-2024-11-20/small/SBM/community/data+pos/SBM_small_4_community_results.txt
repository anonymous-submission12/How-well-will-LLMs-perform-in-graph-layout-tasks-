To determine which layout visually maintains the community structure better, we can evaluate the spatial grouping of nodes based on edge connectivity and cluster formation. Here's the assessment:

1. **Layout 1**:
    - Nodes appear more spread out, and communities are distinguishable due to their separation. For example, nodes forming specific clusters like `{0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 6, ...}` are closer to each other, showing clearer community distinction.
    - Spatial clusters (e.g., `{21, 22, 23, ...}` and `{14, 15, 16, ...}`) are well-separated.

2. **Layout 2**:
    - Nodes are grouped closer together globally, but the spatial separation between communities is less pronounced. This makes the clusters harder to distinguish visually.
    - Communities seem less structured, despite proximity.

**Final Answer: Layout 1 provides clearer community structure.**
