To determine which graph layout has fewer edge crossings, observe the images carefully.

Based on visual inspection:

- **Layout 1 (Image 1)** has a densely connected central region with numerous edge crossings.
- **Layout 2 (Image 2)** organizes the graph into distinct clusters with significantly fewer overlaps between edges.

Thus, **Layout 2** has fewer edge crossings than Layout 1.
