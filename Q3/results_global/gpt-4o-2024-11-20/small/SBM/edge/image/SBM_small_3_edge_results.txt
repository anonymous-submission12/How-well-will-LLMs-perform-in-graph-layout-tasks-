To determine which graph layout has fewer edge crossings, we visually inspect the images:

- **Image 1**: The edges are densely packed, especially in the central region, leading to a significant number of crossings.
- **Image 2**: The graph layout is more spread out, and the edges are less tangled, resulting in fewer crossings.

Based on this observation, **Image 2** has fewer edge crossings.
