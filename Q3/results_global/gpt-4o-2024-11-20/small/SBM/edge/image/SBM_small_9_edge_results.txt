To determine which graph layout has fewer edge crossings, we visually inspect the images. 

In the first image, there are numerous edge crossings, especially in the central region where edges are densely packed. 

In the second image, the edges are more spread out, and there are fewer crossings overall.

Thus, **Layout 2** has fewer edge crossings.
