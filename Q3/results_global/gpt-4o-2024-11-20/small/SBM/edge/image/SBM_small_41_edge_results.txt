To determine which graph layout has the fewest edge crossings, we visually inspect the images:

- **Image 1**: The graph appears to have a higher density of edge crossings, especially in the central region where multiple edges overlap.
- **Image 2**: The graph layout is more spread out, and the edges are arranged in a way that minimizes crossings.

Based on this observation, **Image 2** has fewer edge crossings.
