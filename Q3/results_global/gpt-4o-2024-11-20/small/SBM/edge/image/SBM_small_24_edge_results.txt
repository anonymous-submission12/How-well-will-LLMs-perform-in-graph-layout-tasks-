Analyzing both images visually:

1. In the first layout, the edges are densely interconnected, and numerous edge crossings are observed throughout the graph.
  
2. In the second layout, the graph appears to be spread out more effectively, minimizing edge crossings compared to the first layout.

Based on this observation, the second layout (Answer 2) has fewer edge crossings.
