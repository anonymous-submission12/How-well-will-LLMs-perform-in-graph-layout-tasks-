To determine which graph layout has the fewest number of edge crossings, we need to evaluate the number of times edges intersect in each layout based on the provided node coordinates. This is a computational geometry problem.

Given the complexity of manually visualizing and counting edge crossings, writing a code algorithm is the most practical approach. However, without running computations, I can provide a conceptual explanation of how both layouts may differ based on their coordinates. Unfortunately, relying solely on coordinates and mathematical deduction without computation cannot provide concrete results.
