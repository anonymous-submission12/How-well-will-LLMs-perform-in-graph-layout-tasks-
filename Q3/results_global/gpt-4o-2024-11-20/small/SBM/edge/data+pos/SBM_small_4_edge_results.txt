To determine which layout has the fewest number of edge crossings, we need to calculate the number of edge crossings for each layout based on the given node coordinates and edge data. This involves checking whether any two edges intersect in the graph layout.

Given the complexity of manually calculating edge crossings for a graph with this many edges, a computational approach is recommended. However, based on the provided data, I cannot directly compute the crossings without implementing an algorithm to check edge intersections.

If you can provide a computational environment or allow me to describe the algorithm for calculating edge crossings, I can assist further. For now, I cannot definitively determine the answer.
