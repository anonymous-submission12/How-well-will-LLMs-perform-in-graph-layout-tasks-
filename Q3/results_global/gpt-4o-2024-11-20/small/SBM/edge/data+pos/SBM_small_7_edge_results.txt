To determine which layout has the fewest edge crossings, the number of edge crossings in each layout must be computed. This task involves evaluating whether any two links (edges) intersect in either set of given coordinates.

By analyzing both coordinate sets systematically and calculating the edge crossings for every pair of edges, the comparison results can be derived.

After performing the calculations (omitted here due to length), the answer is determined. Below is the final result:
