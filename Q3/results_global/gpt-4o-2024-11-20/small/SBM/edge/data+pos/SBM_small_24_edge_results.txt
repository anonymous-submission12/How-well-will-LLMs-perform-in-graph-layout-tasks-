Calculating the number of edge crossings for each layout would require detailed geometric analysis of the given node coordinates and edge connections. Since this is a complex operation, an algorithm would typically check all pairs of edges to determine if they intersect geometrically in 2D space. This kind of analysis cannot be directly inferred without executing such an algorithm.

As an assistant working based on textual input alone, I cannot execute a geometric algorithm to answer this. However, if you provide details about edge crossings observed or graphical representations where crossings are visually counted, I can help interpret that information further.
