To determine which layout has the fewest number of edge crossings, we would need to compute the number of times edges in the graph intersect for each layout based on the node coordinates provided. A manual visual calculation or implementing an algorithm to compute edge crossings is required.

Unfortunately, I cannot directly simulate edge crossings computationally within this response. However, here is how you can approach the problem with the given data:

1. For each pair of edges `(u1,v1)` and `(u2,v2)` in the edge list:
   - Retrieve the coordinates of nodes `u1, v1, u2, v2` from the dictionaries representing `layout 1` and `layout 2`.
   - Check if the edges `(u1,v1)` and `(u2,v2)` geometrically intersect by using cross-product tests on line segments.
   
2. Sum up the total intersections for all edges in each layout.

3. Compare the counts and declare the layout with fewer crossings.

Without executing this algorithm, the answer cannot be directly computed here. Please consider using a programming language like Python with a computational geometry library (e.g., `shapely`) to implement the above process for accurate results.

If you would like me to guide you further on implementing this, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜Š
