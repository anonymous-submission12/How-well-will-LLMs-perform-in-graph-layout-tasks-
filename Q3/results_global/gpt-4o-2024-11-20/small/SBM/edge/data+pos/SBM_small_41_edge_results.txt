To determine which layout has the fewest number of edge crossings, considering the positions of the nodes and the connections (edges) between them, we would need to visually or computationally analyze how many times edges intersect.

This task is computationally expensive and time-consuming to process manually. Given the edge data and node coordinates alone, without a visualization or a specialized solver/program to calculate this reliably, it's impractical to definitively state which layout has fewer crossings accurately within this context. However, if such tools/resources are unavailable for immediate use, visual or iterative analysis programs(using lib networkx etc
