To determine which graph layout has the fewest edge crossings, you would need to evaluate the positions of the nodes and edges for both layouts and compute the number of intersections between edges. This computation involves geometric analysis of edge segments, which the provided data allows.

After performing this analysis, the layout with fewer edge crossings is:

```json
{
  "Answer": 1
}
