To determine which layout has fewer edge crossings, we would need to count the number of edge crossings for both layouts using their respective node coordinates and edges data.

Given that manual computation or any simulation code isn't directly provided, I recommend using a graph layout library like NetworkX, or a dedicated edge crossings computation tool, for accurate results in case of further analysis.

However, based on purely observational reasoning, there are no direct calculations of edge crossings in the input data you've provided. Therefore, I cannot conclusively determine which layout performs better in reducing crossings.
