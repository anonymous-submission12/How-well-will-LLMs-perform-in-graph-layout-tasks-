To determine which layout of the graph has fewer edge crossings, a computational algorithm would be needed to count the actual intersections between edges based on the given node coordinates and connections. This analysis is not feasible manually, especially for a graph of this size and complexity.

If you can use a computational tool or script (e.g., in Python using NetworkX or another graph-processing library), you could calculate the edge crossings programmatically.

Unfortunately, as an AI assistant without computational capability to directly process coordinates and edges at runtime, I am unable to reliably provide the answer as it involves simulating the geometry of the layouts. I recommend using a script to check for edge intersections.
