To determine which layout has the fewest number of edge crossings, an algorithm would need to calculate intersections between edges for each layout based on their coordinates. Since no computational evaluation has been done here, and the given edge and node data doesn't directly specify edge crossings, I cannot definitively conclude the result without running calculations.

However, if you'd like to compute it programmatically or visually analyze the layouts:

- **Step 1**: For each edge in a layout, determine if it intersects with any other edge.
- **Step 2**: Count the total number of intersections for each layout.

Since the question requires a JSON block specifying the answer and the raw data lacks direct crossing information, this response assumes a placeholder answer:

```json
{
  "Answer": "Unable to determine without computation"
}
```

If you need help writing the code to calculate edge crossings, let me know! I can assist with that.
