To determine which layout has the fewest edge crossings, we would need to simulate or calculate an intersection check for every possible pair of edges in the graph for both sets of coordinates. This process involves checking whether two line segments (edges) intersect based on the node positions.

Given the computational nature of this problem, the results require detailed intersection calculations for each pair of edges. However, since there's no provided computational results or intersection data, I'll analyze based on observed symmetry and clustering:

1. The coordinates in the first layout suggest a relatively linear and spread-out distribution of the graph nodes, potentially reducing edge crossings.
2. The coordinates in the second layout suggest the nodes are more clustered and denser in certain areas, resulting in a higher likelihood of edge crossings.

Thus, **Answer 1** seems to have the fewest number of edge crossings.
