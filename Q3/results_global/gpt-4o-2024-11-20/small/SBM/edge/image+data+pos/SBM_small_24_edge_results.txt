To determine which graph layout has fewer edge crossings, we need to visually inspect the images provided. Based on the images:

- **Image 1** has a denser arrangement of edges, leading to more crossings.
- **Image 2** has a more spread-out layout, resulting in fewer edge crossings.

Thus, **Image 2** has fewer edge crossings.
