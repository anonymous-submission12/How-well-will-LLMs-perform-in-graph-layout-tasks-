To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to compare the Euclidean distances between nodes in the layouts with their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances in the graph). 

From visual inspection and the provided coordinates:
- **Layout 1** appears to spread out clusters of nodes more distinctly, making it easier to visually interpret distances between connected components and clusters.
- **Layout 2** compresses the graph, which may distort the relative distances between nodes, especially for nodes in different clusters.

Given the graph data and coordinates, **Layout 1** better preserves graph-theoretic distances because it maintains a clearer separation between clusters and reflects the connectivity structure more accurately.
