To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, consider how closely the Euclidean distances between nodes in the layout correspond to the shortest-path distances in the graph topology. 

In the first layout (Answer 1), the nodes appear to be placed in a closer proximity and form clusters based on graph-theoretic connections. However, the entire graph is interconnected without emphasizing the separation between different components. This can make the graph-theoretic distances less evident in the Euclidean space.

In the second layout (Answer 2), the graph is visually separated into clusters, which better reflects the modular structure of the graph. Nodes that are part of independent subgraphs are spatially separated, enhancing the correspondence between Euclidean and graph-theoretic distances.

Thus, **Answer 2** preserves graph-theoretic distances better.
