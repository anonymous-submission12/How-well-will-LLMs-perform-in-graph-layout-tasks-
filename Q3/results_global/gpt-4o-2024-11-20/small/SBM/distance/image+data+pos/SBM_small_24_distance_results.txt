To observe which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to compare how closely the Euclidean distances in the layouts correspond to the graph distances in terms of node connectivity.

From visual inspection of the layouts:
- Answer 1 represents a layout where tightly connected clusters appear more compressed and closely grouped.
- Answer 2 seems to stretch out the clusters more linearly, potentially distorting connectivity-based distances.

Graph-theoretic distance refers to the shortest path (number of edges) between nodes. The closeness of nodes in a layout should reflect such distances. **Answer 1 better preserves graph-theoretic distance** because it positions nodes more compactly within clusters, reflecting shorter graph-based shortest paths, while Answer 2 distorts these distances due to stretched spacing.
