To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to evaluate how well the spatial distances between nodes in the layout correspond to their shortest-path distances in the graph. 

From the images provided:
- **Layout 1** (first image) appears to have nodes clustered closely together, which may distort the representation of graph-theoretic distances, especially for nodes that are farther apart in the graph.
- **Layout 2** (second image) separates the clusters more distinctly, which better reflects the graph-theoretic distances between nodes, especially for nodes in different clusters.

Based on this observation, **Layout 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
