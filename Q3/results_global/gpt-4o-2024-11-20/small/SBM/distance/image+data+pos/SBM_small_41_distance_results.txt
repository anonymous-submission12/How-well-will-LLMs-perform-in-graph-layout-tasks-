To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we compare the geometric distances between node pairs in the layouts to their graph-theoretic (shortest path) distances computed from the graph data. 

From visual inspection of the two layouts:

- **Layout 1 (Image 1)**: Nodes in separate clusters appear spaced apart, which aligns more closely with how graph-theoretic distances structure the graph into clusters. Short distances between nodes within clusters appear preserved.
- **Layout 2 (Image 2)**: Nodes seem more uniformly spaced across the layout, and the structure is less indicative of strong clustering.

Since preserving graph-theoretic distances typically results in layouts that reflect cluster separation and maintain proximity within clusters, **Layout 1** seems to better preserve graph-theoretic distances.
