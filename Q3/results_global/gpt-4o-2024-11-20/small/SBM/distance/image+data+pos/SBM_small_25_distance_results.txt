To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to compare the Euclidean distances between nodes in the layouts with their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances in the graph). 

From the images provided:
- **Layout 1** appears to have nodes clustered in a way that does not clearly reflect the graph-theoretic distances. Nodes that are far apart in the graph-theoretic sense are sometimes placed close together spatially.
- **Layout 2** seems to better separate clusters and reflects the graph-theoretic distances more accurately. Nodes that are part of the same cluster are closer together, while nodes from different clusters are farther apart.

Based on visual inspection and the provided data, **Layout 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distances.
