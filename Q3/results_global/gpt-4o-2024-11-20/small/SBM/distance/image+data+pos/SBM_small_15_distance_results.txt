To determine which graph layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance:

**Graph-Theoretic Distance** refers to the shortest path between nodes in the graph, calculated using edge connections.

**Euclidean Distance in the Layout:** Each layout positions nodes in 2D space, affecting how well pairwise Euclidean distances in the layout reflect actual graph-theoretic distances.

### Observations:
1. **Answer 1 (First Layout, Coordinates in First Format):**
   - Nodes from different clusters are close together.
   - Clusters overlap spatially, making it harder to distinguish graph-theoretic groups.
   - Euclidean distances between nodes don't strongly correlate with graph-theoretic distances (e.g., disconnected parts of the graph appear close).

2. **Answer 2 (Second Layout, Coordinates in Second Format):**
   - Two graph components are clearly spatially separated.
   - Nodes within each cluster are closer to each other spatially, better representing large graph-theoretic distances between clusters.
   - This layout better reflects the actual structure (e.g., clustering and connective gaps).

### Conclusion:
**Answer 2 preserves graph-theoretic distances better.**
