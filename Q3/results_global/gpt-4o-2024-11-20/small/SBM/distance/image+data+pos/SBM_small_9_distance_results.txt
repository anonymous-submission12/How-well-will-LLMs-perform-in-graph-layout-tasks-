To determine which layout better preserves the graph-theoretic distances, we analyze the structural properties reflected in the placements of nodes.

Looking at the two layouts:
- **Layout 1 (Answer 1)** groups nodes into clusters based on their connections, maintaining proximity between nodes connected by edges. The visual distances between nodes align well with their graph-theoretic distances.
- **Layout 2 (Answer 2)** elongates the layout, stretching clusters apart. This distorts distances, especially across different subgraphs.

Based on the clarity of connections and proximity preservation, **Layout 1 (Answer 1)** better mirrors graph-theoretic distance.
