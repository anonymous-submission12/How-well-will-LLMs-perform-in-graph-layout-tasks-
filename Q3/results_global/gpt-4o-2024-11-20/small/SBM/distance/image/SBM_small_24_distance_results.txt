To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, one must compare spatial relationships between nodes in the two images and assess if these align with the graph-theoretic distances (shortest path or number of edges between nodes).

The second layout aligns better with graph-theoretic distance, as it visually separates clusters and spaces them proportionately to their connectivity. Unlike the first layout, it reduces overlap and preserves structural relationships with clearer distances.
