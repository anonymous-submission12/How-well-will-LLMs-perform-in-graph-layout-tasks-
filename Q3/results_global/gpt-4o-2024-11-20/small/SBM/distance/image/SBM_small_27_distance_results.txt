To analyze which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance purely from the visual representation provided:

**Observation:**
1. In Answer 1: The layout is more compact, causing overlapping edges and nodes. While it may make some local distances and clusters easy to interpret, global graph-theoretic distances may appear distorted due to reduced spacing between logical clusters of nodes.
  
2. In Answer 2: The graph layout is spread out and elongated. Nodes on opposite ends or in different clusters preserve their graph-theoretic distance better, as physical spacing matches logical grouping and connection paths.

**Conclusion:** Answer 2 better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
