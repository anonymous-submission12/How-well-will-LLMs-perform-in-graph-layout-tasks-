To determine which graph layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to analyze how well the spatial positions of the nodes represent their shortest-path distances in the graph. 

- **Layout 1**: The nodes are scattered across the canvas with no apparent clustering. This makes it harder to visually discern the graph-theoretic distances, as nodes that should be close based on graph connections might appear far apart in the spatial layout.
  
- **Layout 2**: Nodes are grouped into two distinct clusters, with a clear connection between the two groups. This arrangement more closely mirrors graph-theoretic distances, especially for nodes within each cluster. Nodes in the same cluster are spatially closer, consistent with shorter paths in the graph.

**Conclusion**: Layout 2 better preserves graph-theoretic distances, as it visually groups nodes in accordance with their approximate proximity in the graph structure.
