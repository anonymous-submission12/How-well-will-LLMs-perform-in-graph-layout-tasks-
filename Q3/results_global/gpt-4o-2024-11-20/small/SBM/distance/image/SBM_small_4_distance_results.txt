To determine which graph layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we look for visual cues that indicate a proportional representation of distances or "path lengths" between nodes in the graph. 

Layout Answer 2 shows a more spatially proportional distribution, where clusters of nodes are spaced consistently across the graph according to their connectivity in the underlying graph structure. This suggests that it better respects graph-theoretic distance.

In Layout Answer 1, while nodes are well-distributed, clusters overlap or are very tightly arranged, making it harder to interpret distances.
