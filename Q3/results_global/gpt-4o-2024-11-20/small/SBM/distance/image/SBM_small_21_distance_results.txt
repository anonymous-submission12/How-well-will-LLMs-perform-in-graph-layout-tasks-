To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to evaluate how well the spatial arrangement of nodes reflects the shortest path distances between them in the graph. 

In **Layout 1**, the clusters of nodes are spread out, and the distances between clusters are visually larger. This layout appears to better represent the graph-theoretic distances, as nodes within the same cluster are closer together, and the connections between clusters are visually elongated, reflecting the longer graph-theoretic distances.

In **Layout 2**, the clusters are more compact, and the distances between clusters are visually smaller. This compactness may distort the perception of graph-theoretic distances, as the spatial distances between clusters do not clearly reflect the longer graph-theoretic distances.

Thus, **Layout 1** better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
