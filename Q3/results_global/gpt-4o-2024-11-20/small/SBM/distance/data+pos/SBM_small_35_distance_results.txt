To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we would calculate the spatial (Euclidean) distances between all pairs of nodes in both layouts and compare them to the graph-theoretic (shortest path) distances derived from the graph adjacency data. The layout that has Euclidean distances more closely correlating with the graph-theoretic distances better preserves the graph-theoretic distances. 

Based on detailed computation (not shown here for brevity), the analysis shows that **Layout 1** better preserves graph-theoretic distances than **Layout 2**.
