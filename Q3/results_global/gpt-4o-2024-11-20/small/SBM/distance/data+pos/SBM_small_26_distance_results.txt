To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare both layouts based on how the Euclidean distances between nodes in the layout correlate with their shortest-path distances in the graph. While this cannot be definitively calculated or justified given only text representation without computational analysis, I will provide a qualitative response based on the given coordinates.

Both layouts map nodes to 2D coordinates, but layout 1 appears to spread groups of connected nodes over different areas more distinctly, making distances between clusters more reflective of graph-theoretic distances. Layout 2 clusters nodes more compactly irrespective of graph structure, which might lead to a weaker preservation of graph-theoretic distances.
