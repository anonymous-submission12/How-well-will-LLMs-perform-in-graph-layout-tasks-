To compare the two layouts in terms of preserving graph-theoretic distance, one approach is to assess how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in the layouts correlate with the graph-theoretic distances in the graph. Graph-theoretic distance is the shortest path distance between two nodes in the graph.

Here's the final answer:

  "Answer": 1
}
```

Explanation:
Based on the provided data, layout 1 seems to have nodes placed closer together in groups that are connected in the graph, using coordinates that better reflect graph-theoretic connections and clusters. Layout 2 exhibits more spread in coordinates, which may distort the integrity of graph-theoretic distances when analyzed pairwise.
