To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, I need to evaluate how well the spatial Euclidean distances between node pairs reflect the shortest path lengths (graph-theoretic distances) in the graph. This involves comparing the node positions in both layouts and assessing their alignment with the graph structure.

After analyzing the two layouts, **Layout 1** demonstrates closer adherence between spatial Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance. Therefore:
