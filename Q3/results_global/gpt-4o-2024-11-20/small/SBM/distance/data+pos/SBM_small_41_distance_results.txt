To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, the Euclidean distances based on given node coordinates should correlate more closely with the shortest-path distances in the graph data. The decision involves comparing the layout geometries with the inherent distances of the graph structure.

Analyzing the given datasets:
1. **Answer 1** has nodes distributed without tight clusters, emphasizing clear separation between structurally distant nodes.
2. **Answer 2** features more compact grouping in visual space, potentially introducing noise where nodes close in graph-theoretic distance appear closer geometrically.

Thus preserving bonds Clean.
