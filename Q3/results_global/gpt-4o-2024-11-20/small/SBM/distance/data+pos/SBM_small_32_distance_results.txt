To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we would compute the pairwise Euclidean distances in the given layouts and compare them to the shortest-path graph-theoretic distances for the graph. The layout that better correlates with the graph-theoretic distances is the one that better preserves the distance.

After analyzing this comparison, the answer is:
