To determine which graph layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we compare the Euclidean distances between node pairs in the given layouts with the shortest path distances in the graph. The layout that has smaller deviations from graph-theoretic distances is preferable.

After computing and analyzing the deviations for both layouts:
