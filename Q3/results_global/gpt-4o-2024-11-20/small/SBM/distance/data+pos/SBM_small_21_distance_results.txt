To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to evaluate how well the Euclidean distances in the layout correspond to the graph-theoretic (shortest path) distances captured in the graph's structure.

Graph data provides the connectivity, and the node coordinates define their positions in the respective layouts. Nodes with shorter graph-theoretic distances should ideally have smaller Euclidean distances in the corresponding layout. 

After comparing the two layouts:

- **Answer 1** better preserves graph-theoretic distances: In the first layout, nodes within clusters (e.g., {0, 2, 3, ..., 9}, {10, 11, ..., 19}, {20, 21, ..., 29}) are visually closer in terms of their coordinates compared to their graph-theoretic distances, and inter-cluster distances are visibly larger. This adheres closely to the connectivity described in the graph data.

- **Answer 2**, while grouping nodes broadly, does not preserve graph-theoretic distances as accurately. For example:
  - Nodes within the same cluster have similar graph-theoretic distances, but their Euclidean distances are less tightly clustered.
  - Inter-cluster distances are not as clearly defined in the layout.
