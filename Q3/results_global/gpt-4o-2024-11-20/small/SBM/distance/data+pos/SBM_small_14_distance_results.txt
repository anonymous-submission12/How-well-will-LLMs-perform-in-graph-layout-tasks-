To evaluate which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between node coordinates in each layout correspond to their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path lengths) in the given graph. 

Based on the provided subgraph data and layouts, **Answer 1** appears to have a more consistent relationship between graph-theoretic and Euclidean distances. Nodes closer in the graph (in terms of edges and shortest paths) also appear closer in Euclidean space. In contrast, **Answer 2** shows significant inconsistencies, where some nodes farther apart graph-theoretically are placed closer Euclidean-wise and vice versa.
