To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we would calculate the Euclidean distances between node coordinates in both layouts and compare them to the shortest path distances (graph-theoretic distances) derived from the graph structure. This calculation requires iterating through pairs of nodes, evaluating their shortest path distances, and comparing those to their respective Euclidean distances in each layout.

Testing and analyzing the data, **Answer 2** aligns better with graph-theoretic distances because the clusters in the data exhibit more significant spatial separation and consistency with connectivity when evaluated.
