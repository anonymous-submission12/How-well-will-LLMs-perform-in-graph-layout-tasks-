To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, a comparison of the Euclidean distances between node pairs in the provided coordinates against their graph-theoretic distances (shortest paths) is required. Here, a simplified analysis suggests layout 1 represents distances closer to graph-theoretic distances than layout 2 based on comparative proximity between connected nodes.
