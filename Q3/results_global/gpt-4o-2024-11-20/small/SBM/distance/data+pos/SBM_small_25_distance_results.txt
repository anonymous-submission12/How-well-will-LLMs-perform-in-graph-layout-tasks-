To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to evaluate how closely the Euclidean distances between node positions in each layout correspond to their shortest-path distances in the graph topology. A direct calculation is required, but here is the reasoning:

1. **Graph-theoretic distance** measures the shortest path between two nodes in terms of edges (hops).
2. **Euclidean distance** measures the straight-line distance between two nodes in the layout based on their coordinates.

Let me summarize after calculating:

### Answer 1: Correspondence in Layout 1
Based on the first set of node coordinates, the geometric layout of highly connected *proxim..
