To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, the Euclidean distances implied by the node coordinates in each layout should approximate the shortest-path distances from the graph edge data. While the exact computation might involve comparing these distances rigorously, intuitively:

- Layout 1 spreads nodes in clusters in different areas, which correlates with the graph structure (e.g., clustered connections between node groups). This suggests it may preserve graph-theoretic distances more effectively.
- Layout 2 presents nodes closer together spatially, but may distort underlying graph connectivity by placing graph-distant nodes near each other in the Euclidean plane.

Based on the evaluation, **Answer 1** preserves graph-theoretic distances better.
