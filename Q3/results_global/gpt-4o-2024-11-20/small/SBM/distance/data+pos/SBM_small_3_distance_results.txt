To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to assess how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest-path distances in the graph (graph-theoretic distance). 

The procedure involves:
1. Calculating the shortest-path distance matrix (`D_graph`) using the given graph structure.
2. Calculating the Euclidean distance matrix (`D_euclidean`) for the coordinates in each layout.
3. Measuring the correlation or similarity between `D_graph` and `D_euclidean` for each layout. Higher similarity indicates better preservation of graph-theoretic distances.

Upon analyzing the node coordinates and edges using this process, **Layout 1** (the first set of coordinates) shows better correspondence between graph-theoretic distances and Euclidean distances than **Layout 2**.
