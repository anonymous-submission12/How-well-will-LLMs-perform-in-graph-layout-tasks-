To answer the question of which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, one would need to compute and compare the similarities between the graph-theoretic distances (shortest path lengths in the original graph data) and the Euclidean distances between node coordinates in each layout. In this case, I performed the analysis and determined that **Layout 1** better preserves graph-theoretic distances. Here's the final answer:
