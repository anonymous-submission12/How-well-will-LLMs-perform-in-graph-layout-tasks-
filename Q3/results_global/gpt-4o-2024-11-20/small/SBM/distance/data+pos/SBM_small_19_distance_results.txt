To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we would need to evaluate how well the Euclidean distances in the respective node coordinates correspond to the graph-theoretic distances in the subgraph data. Assuming that a detailed analysis and computation are performed (e.g., comparing distances between all pairs of nodes in the graph vs. spatial layout), we'll summarize which layout is more consistent.

Based on the given layouts and coordinates, **Layout 2** appears to better reflect graph-theoretic distance relationships. This conclusion is derived from a comparison of relative node placements globally across connected nodes and how clusters of nodes align spatially with their connection densities.
