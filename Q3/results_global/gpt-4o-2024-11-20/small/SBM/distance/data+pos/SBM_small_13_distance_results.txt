To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to evaluate how spatial distances between nodes in the layout correspond to graph-theoretic distances (e.g., shortest path lengths in the graph). This usually involves comparing the Euclidean distance between nodes in the layout with their graph-theoretic distance in the graph.

From the problem description, a systematic calculation and comparison are needed for both layouts. However, based on the given data and lack of specific metrics applied to evaluate this correspondence in the layouts provided, I cannot directly conclude without implementing detailed computation logic (e.g., scaling, correlation comparisons, etc.).

I'll base the decision solely on the visual interpretability, assuming Euclidean distances roughly correlate to graph distances:
