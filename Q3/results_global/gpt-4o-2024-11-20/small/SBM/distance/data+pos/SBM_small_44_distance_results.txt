To evaluate which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we can compute the Euclidean distances between nodes for both layouts and compare them against the shortest path distances in the graph-theoretic sense. The layout whose Euclidean distances more closely align with the graph-theoretic distances better preserves them.

### Analysis:
After comparison of both layouts based on graph-theoretic distances provided in the `<subgraph_data>` against Euclidean distances derived from the node coordinates, **Layout 1** exhibits higher fidelity to graph-theoretic distances.
