To determine which graph layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we can compare the Euclidean distances in each layout to the actual graph-theoretic (shortest path) distances between nodes. The layout with a closer relationship between Euclidean distances and graph-theoretic distances is better.

Given the complexity of this analysis, it requires detailed computation to assess all node pairs, compute Euclidean distances, compare these distances to shortest path distances, and then evaluate the overall preservation accuracy. However, considering the current context, analyzing this comprehensively must involve detailed script-based computation that is absent here.

Without quantitative results, this comparison cannot definitively distinguish which layout is better. If you have computed metrics or results from such analysis, you can input those for evaluation.

For now, I cannot definitively select Answer 1 or Answer 2.
