To determine which graph layout has fewer edge crossings, we visually inspect the images:

- **Image 1**: The edges appear to cross multiple times near the center.
- **Image 2**: The edges are arranged more evenly, resulting in fewer crossings near the center.

Based on this observation, **Image 2** has fewer edge crossings.
