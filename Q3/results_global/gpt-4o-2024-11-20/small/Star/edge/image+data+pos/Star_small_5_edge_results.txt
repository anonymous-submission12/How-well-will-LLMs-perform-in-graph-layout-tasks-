To effectively determine which layout has the fewest edge crossings, a close examination of the visual representation in the two images is required. In both images, node '0' is connected to all other nodes, forming a star-like structure. However, upon closer inspection:

1. In the first image, the edges seem to intersect at multiple points as they radiate outward from the central node ('0').
2. In the second image, the edges appear to be more evenly spread, with fewer intersections visible.

Based on the visual examination, **layout 2 has fewer edge crossings than layout 1.**
