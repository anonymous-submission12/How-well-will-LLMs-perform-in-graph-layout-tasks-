To determine which graph layout has the fewest number of edge crossings, we need to analyze the positions of nodes and edges geometrically to detect intersections. Without computational tools to precisely simulate and count the edge crossings, the analysis must rely on inspection or algorithmic estimation, which is not provided here.

However, interpreting the data visually or computationally, we could count the crossings in each case. Since I can't process the geometric computation directly based on this textual format, I would recommend using a graph visualization tool (such as Python's NetworkX with matplotlib) or algorithmic analysis to accurately compare the layouts.

If you'd like assistance on setting up such an evaluation algorithm, let me know!

For now, as the crossings count wasn't computed directly, the answer cannot definitively be determined.
