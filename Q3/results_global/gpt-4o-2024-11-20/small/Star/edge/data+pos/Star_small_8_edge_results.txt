To determine which graph layout has the fewest edge crossings, we need to calculate the number of crossings for each layout based on given edge_data and node coordinates. For brevity, I'll summarize the process and provide the final answer:

1. **Calculate Edge Crossings**:
   - For each pair of edges `(u1, v1)` and `(u2, v2)` in the edge_data:
     - Calculate if the two edges cross by checking their geometric intersection based on coordinates of the endpoints.

2. **Process Details**:
   - With the given coordinates and edges, compute for both layouts to find the total number of edge crossings.

3. **Result**:
   - After calculating, **Layout 2** has fewer crossings compared to **Layout 1**.
