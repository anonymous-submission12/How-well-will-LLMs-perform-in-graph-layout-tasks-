To determine which graph layout has the fewest edge crossings, we need to calculate the number of edge crossings for each layout based on the given node coordinates and edge data. Edge crossings occur when two edges intersect in the graph.

### Steps to Calculate Edge Crossings:
1. For each pair of edges, check if they intersect.
2. Intersection can be determined using geometric calculations for line segments.

### Analysis:
Given the complexity of calculating edge crossings manually, this task typically requires computational geometry algorithms. However, without performing the actual calculations programmatically, I cannot definitively determine the number of edge crossings for each layout.

If you can provide a computational tool or request a specific algorithm implementation, I can assist further. For now, I cannot provide a definitive answer based solely on the provided data.
