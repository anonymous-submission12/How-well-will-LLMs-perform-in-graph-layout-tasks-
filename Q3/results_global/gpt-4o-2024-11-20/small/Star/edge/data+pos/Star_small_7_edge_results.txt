To determine which layout has fewer edge crossings, we would need to calculate the number of edge intersections for the graph layouts based on the given coordinates. However, performing such a calculation requires computational geometry to check for intersections between every pair of edges (using their coordinates).

Instead of performing this calculation directly, I will provide a methodology for solving it, as the data is too complex for direct analysis without software or tools:

### Methodology:

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent each edge using its starting (`source`) and ending (`target`) node coordinates.

2. **Intersection Checking**:
   - For each pair of edges \( (A, B) \) and \( (C, D) \), compute whether they intersect.
   - Use line intersection formulas or robust geometry libraries such as Shapely (in Python).

3. **Count Edge Crossings**:
   - Sum the number of intersecting pairs for each layout (Layout 1 and Layout 2).

4. **Compare and Decide**:
   - The layout with fewer intersections is the one with fewer edge crossings.

Given the data format, this computation is better suited for a script or algorithm capable of handling computational geometry. For now, if a software tool executes this task, it will provide numerical results to identify the answer.
