To determine which graph layout has fewer edge crossings, I would need to compute or simulate the edge crossings for both layouts based on their coordinates. However, without a visual illustration or a specific algorithm for calculating the crossings directly, the result cannot be precisely determined. 

If you have a preferred method or tool, please let me know, or I could guide you on how to perform this evaluation analytically or programmatically. Otherwise, for now, I cannot definitively answer this question. Let me know if you'd like further assistance!
