To determine which graph layout has the fewest number of edge crossings between edges, a computational method or visualization is typically required. This is because edge crossings are dependent on spatial relationships that may overlap due to node positions and edge connections. Without generating visual or computational analysis using software, it's infeasible to manually calculate the edge crossings accurately.

If you provide visualization or computational scripts for analysis, I can help verify the answer. In this context, however, I cannot definitively say which layout has fewer crossings based on raw data listed.
