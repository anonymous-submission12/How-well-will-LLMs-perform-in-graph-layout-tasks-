To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to evaluate how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in the layout correspond to the graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances) in the graph.

### Analysis:
1. **Graph Structure**:
   - The graph is a star graph with node `0` as the central node connected to all other nodes (`1` to `26`).
   - Graph-theoretic distance:
     - Distance from node `0` to any other node is `1`.
     - Distance between any two peripheral nodes (`1` to `26`) is `2` (via node `0`).

2. **Layouts**:
   - **Layout 1**:
     - Node `0` is at the center, and all other nodes are distributed around it.
     - The Euclidean distances between node `0` and the peripheral nodes are consistent, reflecting the graph-theoretic distance of `1`.
     - Peripheral nodes are spread out, and their pairwise Euclidean distances are larger, which does not correspond well to the graph-theoretic distance of `2`.

   - **Layout 2**:
     - Node `0` is at the center, and all other nodes are distributed around it.
     - The Euclidean distances between node `0` and the peripheral nodes are consistent, reflecting the graph-theoretic distance of `1`.
     - Peripheral nodes are closer to each other compared to Layout 1, better reflecting the graph-theoretic distance of `2`.

### Conclusion:
Layout 2 better preserves graph-theoretic distances because the relative positions of the peripheral nodes more accurately reflect their pairwise graph-theoretic distances.
