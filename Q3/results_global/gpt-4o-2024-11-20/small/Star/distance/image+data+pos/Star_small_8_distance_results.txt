To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, let us analyze the structure based on the provided data. The graph is a star graph, with one central node (`0`) connected directly to all other nodes. The graph-theoretic distance is highly straightforward: the distance between the central node and any other node is `1`, while the distance between any pair of non-central nodes is `2`.

Looking at the layouts, both preserve the star graph's structure and ensure the central node (`0`) is spatially closer to all other nodes compared to non-central ones. **However, the second layout positions nodes more equidistantly and radially away from the central node (`0`), which better reflects the uniform graph-theoretic distance to the central node (1)**. The first layout introduces variabilities in pairwise spatial distances unrelated to the graph-theoretic structure.
