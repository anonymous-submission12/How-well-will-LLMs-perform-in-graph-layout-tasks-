To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to evaluate how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in the layout correspond to the graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances) in the graph.

The graph is a star graph with node `0` as the central node connected to all other nodes. In a star graph:
- The graph-theoretic distance between the central node (`0`) and any other node is `1`.
- The graph-theoretic distance between any two peripheral nodes is `2` (via the central node).

### Analysis of the layouts:
1. **Layout 1**:
   - The central node (`0`) is at `[0.02, -0.0]`, and all other nodes are distributed around it.
   - The Euclidean distances between the central node and peripheral nodes vary significantly, which does not accurately reflect the uniform graph-theoretic distance of `1`.
   - The Euclidean distances between peripheral nodes also vary, which does not correspond to the uniform graph-theoretic distance of `2`.

2. **Layout 2**:
   - The central node (`0`) is at `[0.0, -0.0]`, and all other nodes are distributed more uniformly around it.
   - The Euclidean distances between the central node and peripheral nodes are more consistent, better reflecting the uniform graph-theoretic distance of `1`.
   - The Euclidean distances between peripheral nodes are also more consistent, better reflecting the uniform graph-theoretic distance of `2`.

### Conclusion:
Layout 2 better preserves graph-theoretic distances.
