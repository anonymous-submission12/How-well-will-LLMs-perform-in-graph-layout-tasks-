To answer the question, we must first consider what it means to preserve graph-theoretic distance. Graph-theoretic distance refers to the shortest path or number of edges between two nodes in the graph. Since the graph described is a star graph, all nodes are connected to the central node (node 0) directly with a single edge, so the graph-theoretic distance between the central node (0) and any other node is 1.

The key concept is that a layout that evenly distributes nodes from the central node, keeping proportional distances, better preserves graph-theoretic distances. 

**Evaluation:**

In the first layout (Answer 1), the nodes are more evenly distributed in a circle around the central node. The edges from the central node to other nodes radiate outward in a uniform fashion, suggesting better proportional preservation of distances.

In the second layout (Answer 2), the nodes appear to be distributed haphazardly, with some nodes closer to the central node and others farther away. This uneven distribution might distort the geometric distances relative to the graph-theoretic distances.

**Conclusion:**

The first layout (Answer 1) better preserves graph-theoretic distances by maintaining symmetry and uniform spacing of nodes around the central node.
