To decide which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, it's crucial to analyze the visualizations and provided coordinates. Graph-theoretic distance is determined by the shortest path between nodes considering edge connections; hence, closely connected nodes should ideally be located closer in space in the layout.

Both layouts visually demonstrate a star-like structure, with Node 0 at the center directly connected to all other nodes. This is consistent with the given graph data.

From a graph-theoretic perspective:
1. Node-to-node distances should reflect the 1-hop distance from central Node 0 to each surrounding node (distance = 1).
2. Since all nodes are equidistant (1 hop from the center), geometric distance in the visualization (Euclidean positioning) should ideally reflect uniformity around the center.

For layout comparison:
- **Layout 1 coordinates**: Nodes radiate around Node 0 somewhat uniformly in all directions, maintaining consistent spatial distances closer to their graph-theoretic proximity.
- **Layout 2 coordinates**: Nodes also radiate, but the positioning appears less uniformly distributed in space compared to Layout 1, introducing deviations.

Based on the uniformity of spatial arrangement correlating with the star structure:
**Answer 1** better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
