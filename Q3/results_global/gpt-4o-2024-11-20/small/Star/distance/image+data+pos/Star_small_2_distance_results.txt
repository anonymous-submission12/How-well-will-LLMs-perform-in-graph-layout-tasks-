To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to evaluate how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in the layout correspond to their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances in the graph). 

The graph is a star graph with node `0` as the central node connected to all other nodes. In this graph:
- The graph-theoretic distance between node `0` and any other node is `1`.
- The graph-theoretic distance between any two peripheral nodes (nodes other than `0`) is `2`.

### Analysis of Layouts:
1. **Layout 1**:
   - Node `0` is at the center, and all other nodes are distributed around it.
   - The Euclidean distances between node `0` and the peripheral nodes are consistent with the graph-theoretic distance of `1`.
   - The Euclidean distances between peripheral nodes vary significantly, which does not align well with the graph-theoretic distance of `2`.

2. **Layout 2**:
   - Node `0` is at the center, and all other nodes are distributed around it.
   - The Euclidean distances between node `0` and the peripheral nodes are consistent with the graph-theoretic distance of `1`.
   - The Euclidean distances between peripheral nodes are more uniform compared to Layout 1, better reflecting the graph-theoretic distance of `2`.

### Conclusion:
Layout 2 better preserves graph-theoretic distances because it provides a more uniform representation of distances between peripheral nodes, aligning more closely with the graph-theoretic distance of `2`.
