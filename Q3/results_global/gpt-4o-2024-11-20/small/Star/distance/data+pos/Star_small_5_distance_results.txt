To determine which graph layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to analyze the spatial distances between nodes in the layout and compare them against the graph-theoretic distances (shortest path lengths in the graph).

The given graph is a star graph with node '0' connected to all other nodes, forming direct edges between '0' and each outer node. The graph-theoretic distance between '0' and any other node is 1, and the graph-theoretic distance between any two non-central nodes (e.g., '1' and '2') is 2 (via the central node).

By comparing the spatial distances of the nodes relative to their graph-theoretic distances, we can identify the layout that better preserves this relationship.

### Analysis:
1. **Layout 1:**
   - Central node '0' is relatively close to most outer nodes spatially on the 2D plane.
   - Outer nodes are generally farther from each other, which aligns reasonably well with the graph-theoretic distance of 2 for such pairs.

2. **Layout 2:**
   - Central node '0' appears slightly more evenly spaced with its neighbors compared to Layout 1.
   - However, several outer nodes seem closer to each other spatially than they should be according to the graph-theoretic distance of 2. This implies a potential distortion in their representation.

### Conclusion:
Based on this analysis, **Layout 1** better preserves the graph-theoretic distances between nodes because the spatial distances align more closely with the underlying graph structure.
