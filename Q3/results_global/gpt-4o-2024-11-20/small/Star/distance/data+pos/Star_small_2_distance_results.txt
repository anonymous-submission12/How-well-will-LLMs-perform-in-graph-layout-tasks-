To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout can be compared with the shortest path distances based on the graph structure. Such comparison involves quantitatively correlating the degree to which Euclidean distances approximate the graph's shortest path distances.

Given that the data input specifies two sets of coordinates for identical graph structures, after performing a thorough computational analysis of distance preservation for both layouts:

**Answer 1** better aligns the Euclidean distances between nodes with the graph-theoretic shortest path distances than **Answer 2**.
