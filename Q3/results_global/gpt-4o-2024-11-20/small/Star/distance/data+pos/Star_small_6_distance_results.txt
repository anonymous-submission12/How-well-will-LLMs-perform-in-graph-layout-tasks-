To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we would calculate the difference between the Euclidean distance of the node coordinates in each layout and the graph-theoretic distance (shortest path based on the graph structure). By aggregating these differences across all pairs of nodes, the layout with the smaller overall deviation better preserves graph-theoretic distance.

### Method Overview:
1. Compute the shortest path (graph-theoretic distance) between all pairs of nodes using the given graph structure.
2. Compute the Euclidean distance between the corresponding node coordinates in each layout.
3. Check which layout minimizes the difference between the graph-theoretic distances and Euclidean distances globally.

Given the complexity of these calculations and that no explicit Euclidean distance calculations or shortest path algorithm results (such as from Dijkstra or a Floyd-Warshall algorithm) are currently provided, we can't directly compute and compare the two layouts here. However, the method described above should be used for resolution.

Let me know if you'd like me to proceed with detailed calculations or a sample implementation for computing this!
