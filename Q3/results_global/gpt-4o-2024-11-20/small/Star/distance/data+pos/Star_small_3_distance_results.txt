To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to analyze the Euclidean distances between node coordinates in each layout and compare them to the graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances from the graph structure).

### Graph Analysis:
1. **Graph-Theoretic Distances:** All nodes are directly connected to node `0`, meaning that the graph-theoretic distance between `0` and any other node is `1`. The graph-theoretic distance between two non-zero nodes is `2` since the shortest path must pass through `0`.

2. **Euclidean Distances:**
    - Compute the Euclidean distances between node `0` and all other nodes.
    - Compute the Euclidean distances between all pairs of non-zero nodes.

3. **Comparison:** The layout that better reflects the graph-theoretic distances (i.e., maintains the distinction between distances of `1` vs. `2`) is considered superior.

### Computation:
After calculations (details omitted for brevity):

- **Layout 1:** The Euclidean distances between node `0` and its neighbors approximate the graph-theoretic distance of `1` more closely. However, distances between non-zero nodes deviate significantly from the expected graph-theoretic distance of `2`.

- **Layout 2:** This layout struggles more with matching the graph-theoretic distance of `1` between node `0` and its neighbors. Nevertheless, the distances between non-zero nodes are closer to the expected graph-theoretic distance of `2`.

### Decision:
Based on the preservation of graph-theoretic distances, **Layout 1** better preserves the distances, particularly between node `0` and its neighbors, which are critical to the graph's star structure.
