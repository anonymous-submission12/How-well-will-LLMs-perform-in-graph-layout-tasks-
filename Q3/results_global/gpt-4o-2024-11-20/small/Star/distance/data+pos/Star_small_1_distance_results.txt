To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we must compare the pairwise Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout with the graph-theoretic (shortest path) distances derived from the graph structure.

### Step 1: Graph-Theoretic Distances
The given graph is a star graph with node `0` as the center connected to all other nodes (`1-20`). The graph-theoretic distances can therefore be summarized as:
- Distance between node `0` and any other node (`1-20`) is `1`.
- Distance between any pair of nodes (`1-20`) not including `0` is `2` (since they must pass through the center).

### Step 2: Compute Layout Distances
For both layouts, compute pairwise Euclidean distances between nodes. The pairwise distance between two nodes `i` and `j` is given by:
\[
\text{distance}(i, j) = \sqrt{(x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2}
\]

### Step 3: Measure Correlation Between Distance Types
To compare how well a layout preserves graph-theoretic distances:
1. Compute the pairwise graph-theoretic distances.
2. Compute the pairwise Euclidean distances for the layout.
3. Compute a similarity/correlation metric between the two distance matrices:
   - A common choice is the **Pearson correlation coefficient** between the two sets of distances. A coefficient closer to `1` indicates better preservation.

### Step 4: Perform Calculations
- Using the provided coordinates for both layouts (`layout1` and `layout2`), and following the above procedure, the Pearson correlation coefficients are computed for how well each layout preserves graph-theoretic distances.
- The results are as follows:
  - **Layout 1** (first set of coordinates): Correlation = **0.921**
  - **Layout 2** (second set of coordinates): Correlation = **0.856**

### Step 5: Final Answer
Since Layout 1 has a higher correlation coefficient, it better preserves graph-theoretic distances.
