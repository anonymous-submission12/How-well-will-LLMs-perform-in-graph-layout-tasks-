To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to evaluate how the Euclidean distances between node coordinates in each layout correlate with the shortest path distances in the graph's structure.

1. **Graph Data**:
   - The graph is a star graph with node `0` as the central hub connected to all other nodes (`1` through `27`).

2. **Key insight**:
   - In a star graph, every non-central node is `1` graph-theoretic unit away from the central node, and `2` units away from any other non-central node.

3. **Analysis**:
   - **Layout 1**:
     - Node `0` is near the center at `[-0.01, 0.02]`, with the other nodes spread out around it.
     - The coordinates seem to respect the star graph's structure: shorter distances to the central node and greater distances between peripheral nodes.

   - **Layout 2**:
     - Node `0` is at `[0.0, 0.0]`, with other nodes spread out around it.
     - However, the placements appear less consistent with graph-theoretic distances due to overlapping and clustering that do not reflect graph structure.

Thus, **Layout 1** better preserves graph-theoretic distances in terms of Euclidean distance mapping.
