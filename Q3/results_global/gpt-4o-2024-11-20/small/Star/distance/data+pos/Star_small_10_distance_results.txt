To determine which graph layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the spatial (Euclidean) distances between nodes in each layout to their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path lengths on the graph defined by edges). 

The graph provided is a star graph with node `0` connected to all other nodes (`1` through `29`). In such a graph, the graph-theoretic distance between `0` and any other node is `1`, and the distance between any two nodes other than `0` is `2` (as they must travel "through" node `0`).

Comparing the two layouts:
1. In the first layout, node `0` is located approximately centrally, and other nodes are positioned relatively farther outward. This closely mirrors the graph-theoretic structure of the star graph, where `0` acts as the central hub with uniform direct connections to all other nodes.
2. The second layout places node `0` in the center but positions other nodes in a dispersed manner that introduces spatial patterns not aligned with the graph-theoretic distances. For example, some nodes appear closer to each other spatially, which does not reflect their graph-theoretic distance of `2`.

Based on these observations, **layout 1 better preserves graph-theoretic distances** since it aligns more closely with the structure of the graph as a star.
