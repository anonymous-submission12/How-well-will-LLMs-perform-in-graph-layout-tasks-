To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to consider the relationship between the computed 2D Euclidean distances from the coordinates and the actual graph-theoretic (shortest-path) distances of the graph. A layout that more accurately correlates these two measures is said to preserve graph-theoretic distances better.

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - The graph is a star graph with 24 nodes, where node `0` is the central hub connected to all other nodes. All leaf nodes (1 through 23) are connected directly to node `0`.
   - Graph-theoretic distances are either:
     - Distance 1: Between the center node (`0`) and any leaf node.
     - Distance 2: Between two leaf nodes (via the center node).

2. **Layout 1** (coordinate set 1):
   - Using the node coordinates, we can compute distances between pairs of nodes as Euclidean distances.
   - An optimal layout for this graph would have the central node in the middle and all leaf nodes equidistant from it, at a similar radial distance. This preserves graph-theoretic distances better.

3. **Layout 2** (coordinate set 2):
   - The same Euclidean process applies for these coordinates.
   - This layout appears to have larger variance in distances, which could suggest less preservation of exact graph-theoretic distances.

### Analysis
From detailed manual inspection:
- Layout 1 shows smaller variance in the distances between leaf nodes and the center node, as well as between pairs of leaf nodes.
- Layout 2 has a wider spread in the distances, particularly between pairs of leaf nodes, indicating it strays further from the underlying graph structure.

Thus, **Layout 1 better preserves graph-theoretic distances**.
