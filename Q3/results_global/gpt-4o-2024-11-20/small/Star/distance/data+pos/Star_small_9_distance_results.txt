To determine which graph layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we compare the Euclidean distances in each layout with the actual graph-theoretic distances derived from the edge connections. Typically, the layout that yields Euclidean distances more closely aligned with the graph-theoretic distances is considered the better choice.

To evaluate this systematically:  

1. Compute the graph-theoretic distances between all pairs of nodes in the graph.
2. Calculate the Euclidean distances between nodes in both layouts.
3. Compare the alignment of Euclidean distances to the graph-theoretic distances for each layout.

After performing these calculations, here is the result:

Layout 1 better preserves graph-theoretic distances in comparison to Layout 2.
