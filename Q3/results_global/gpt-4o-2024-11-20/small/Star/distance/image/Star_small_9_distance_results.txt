To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, one would typically analyze how well the spatial arrangement of nodes in the image reflects the shortest path distances in the graph. 

In both images provided, the graph is a star graph, where there is a central node connected to all other nodes directly, and there are no other connections. The graph-theoretic distance between the central node and any other node is 1, while the distance between any two peripheral nodes is 2 (through the center). 

From the images, both layouts seem identical in preserving these distances: nodes are equidistant from the center, reflecting the relationship accurately. Peripheral nodes are evenly spaced around the central node, making their relative distances uniform. Therefore, neither layout has a clear advantage over the other in terms of preserving graph-theoretic distance.
