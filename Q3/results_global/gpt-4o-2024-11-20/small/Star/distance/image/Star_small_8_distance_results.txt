Upon visual inspection, both layouts depict a star graph where nodes are arranged in a radial manner around the central hub. Graph-theoretic distances in a star graph depend solely on the topology, and the depiction does not affect the distances in a significant way. In both images, the layout attempts to preserve the uniformity of distances from the central node to the peripheral nodes. Therefore, there is no significant difference, and both layouts equally preserve graph-theoretic distance.
