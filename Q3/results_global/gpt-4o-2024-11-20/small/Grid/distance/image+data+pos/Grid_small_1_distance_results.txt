To assess which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, the second layout (Answer 2) displays a much clearer adherence to the structure and linear relationships inherent within the graph. The nodes and edges are positioned systematically, reflecting distances more consistently within the graph-theoretic context. Answer 1 appears to introduce a more scattered spatial distribution, making it harder to discern or visually verify graph-theoretic distances.
