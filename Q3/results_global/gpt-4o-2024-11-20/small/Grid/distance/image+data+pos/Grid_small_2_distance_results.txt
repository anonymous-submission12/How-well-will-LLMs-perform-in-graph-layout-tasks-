To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance:

1. **Layout 1** appears to have nodes positioned irregularly, making it harder to visually interpret the graph-theoretic shortest distances (i.e., the minimum number of edges between two nodes). Nearby nodes in Euclidean distance might not correspond to a shorter path in terms of graph-theoretic distance. This can result in distorted representation.

2. **Layout 2** is structured in a grid-like format. This arrangement aligns well with the underlying graph structure. Nodes that are graph-theoretically close (e.g., neighbors on the grid) are close in the Euclidean layout as well. This minimizes distortion and better preserves the graph's inherent shortest-path properties.

**Conclusion**: Layout 2 (Answer 2) better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
