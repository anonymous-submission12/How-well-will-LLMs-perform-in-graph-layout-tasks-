To determine which graph layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we can analyze how the spatial (Euclidean) distances between nodes align with graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distance in terms of edge hops) in each layout. 

From visual and numerical analysis:
- Layout **1** exhibits a more compact structure where neighboring nodes are often placed closer to each other, reflecting graph-theoretic distances adequately.
- Layout **2**, on the other hand, stretches the graph, making nodes appear farther apart spatially even if they are close in graph-theoretic terms. This distortion reduces preservation of graph-theoretic distances.

### Conclusion
Layout **1** better preserves graph-theoretic distances.
