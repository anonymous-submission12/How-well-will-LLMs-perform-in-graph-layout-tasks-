To evaluate which graph layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to assess how well the spatial distances in each layout correspond to the defined graph distances (i.e., shortest path lengths between nodes).

From the provided images and data:

1. **Layout 1**: The nodes are arranged in a more clustered fashion with overlapping and crisscrossing edges. The spatial distances between nodes do not visibly map directly onto graph-theoretic distances, making it harder to discern the relationships between nodes based on positions.

2. **Layout 2**: The nodes are laid out in a cleaner and more linear arrangement. The spatial distances between nodes more closely align with graph-theoretic distances, especially along connected paths.

From the evaluation, **Layout 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distances.
