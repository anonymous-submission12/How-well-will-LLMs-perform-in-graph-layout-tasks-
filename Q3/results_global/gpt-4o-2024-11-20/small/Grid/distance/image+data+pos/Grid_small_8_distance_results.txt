To determine which layout better preserves the graph-theoretic distance, one would typically compute and compare how well the Euclidean distances in the layout correlate with the shortest-path distances in the graph. The visual inspection suggests that layout 2 presents a more linear arrangement, which tends to represent graph-theoretic distances more accurately for tree-like or linear structures.

Based on the visual proximity of nodes connected by edges and the overall structure of the layouts, **Answer 2** appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distances.
