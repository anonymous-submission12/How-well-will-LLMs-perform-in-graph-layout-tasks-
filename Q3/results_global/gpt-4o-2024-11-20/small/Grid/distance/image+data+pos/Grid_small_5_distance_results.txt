To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to evaluate how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in the layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the graph. 

From the images provided:
- **Layout 1** (first image) appears to be a more irregular arrangement, possibly optimized for aesthetic or other criteria.
- **Layout 2** (second image) is a grid-like structure, which aligns more closely with the graph's structure and connectivity.

Given the graph data, the graph is a grid-like structure, and Layout 2 visually matches this structure. This suggests that Layout 2 better preserves graph-theoretic distances because the Euclidean distances between nodes in Layout 2 are more likely to correspond to the shortest path distances in the graph.
