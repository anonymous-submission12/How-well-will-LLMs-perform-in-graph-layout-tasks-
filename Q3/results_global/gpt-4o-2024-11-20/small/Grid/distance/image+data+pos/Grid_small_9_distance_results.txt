To answer this question, let us analyze the preservation of graph-theoretic distance:

### Graph-theoretic distance
Graph-theoretic distance between two nodes refers to the number of edges (or hops) required to traverse between them in the graph. A key feature of good graph layouts is that they should attempt to preserve these distances spatially whenever possible. 

### Observations
- **Layout 1**: The nodes are irregularly placed, distorting the interpretation of graph-theoretic distances. Nodes that are closer to each other in terms of hops may appear far apart spatially.
- **Layout 2**: This layout organizes the graph in a regular grid-like structure. Here, the spatial distance between any two nodes more closely matches their graph-theoretic distance (number of edges), as nodes connected by edges are placed near each other.

**Conclusion**: Layout 2 (Answer 2) better preserves graph-theoretic distances by visually representing the graph's adjacency and connection structure in a consistent format.
