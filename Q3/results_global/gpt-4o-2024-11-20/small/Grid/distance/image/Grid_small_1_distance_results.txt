To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, one needs to consider how spatial distances between nodes correspond to their graph-theoretic distances (number of edges in the shortest path). 

In the first image, nodes appear arranged with overlaps and proximity not necessarily representing connectedness or graph-theoretic proximity directly. This layout may distort the understanding of distances.

In the second image, nodes are laid out respecting graph-theoretic distances more closely. For instance, nodes that are closer in terms of graph-theoretic distance appear near each other spatially, and distant nodes are visually farther apart. This layout simplifies visual interpretation of graph-theoretic distances.

### Conclusion:
**Layout 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distances.
