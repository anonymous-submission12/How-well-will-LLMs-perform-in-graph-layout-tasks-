To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we would need to calculate and compare how well the Euclidean distances between node coordinates in each layout approximate the graph-theoretic distances (shortest path lengths) in the graph. This process generally involves:

1. Calculating graph-theoretic distances between all pairs of nodes in the given graph.
2. Calculating Euclidean distances between all pairs of nodes in each layout.
3. Comparing the correlation between the graph-theoretic distances and the Euclidean distances for each layout (e.g., using Pearson correlation or another statistical metric).
4. Determining which layout has a stronger correlation, indicating better preservation of graph-theoretic distances.

Based on the input provided, I cannot directly compute these values or process the data programmatically. However, if the analysis has been conducted and the results are provided in terms of correlations or metrics, I can interpret them. Since no further analysis results are provided, I am unable to definitively determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance. Thus, I will infer the process generically.
