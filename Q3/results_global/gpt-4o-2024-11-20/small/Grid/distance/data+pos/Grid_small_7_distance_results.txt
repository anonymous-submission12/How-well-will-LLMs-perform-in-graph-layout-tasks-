To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the Euclidean distances between node pairs in the layouts against their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances). 

The first step involves computing graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances) for all node pairs, which we derive from the provided graph's edge list. Then, we compare these theoretical distances with the Euclidean distances in both layouts. The layout that exhibits a stronger correlation between graph-theoretic distances and Euclidean distances is considered to better preserve graph-theoretic distances.

After performing this analysis, the second layout exhibits a stronger correlation between graph-theoretic distances and Euclidean distances.
