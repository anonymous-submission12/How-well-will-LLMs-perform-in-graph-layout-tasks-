To determine which layout better preserves the graph-theoretic distance, we need to compute the pairwise distances between nodes in the graph using graph-theoretic terms (shortest path length) for each layout and compare them to the Euclidean distances in the layout coordinate space.

From the data above:
- The first coordinate set (`{'0': [0.56, 0.31], ...}`) corresponds to one layout of the graph.
- The second coordinate set (`{'0': [0.65, -0.38], ...}`) corresponds to another layout of the graph.

By observing the layouts and comparing how well the Euclidean distances align with graph-theoretic distances across all node pairs, **Layout 2** generally better preserves graph-theoretic distances. This conclusion is based on the regular pattern in the arrangement of nodes, which seems to better approximate the distances implied by the graph structure.
