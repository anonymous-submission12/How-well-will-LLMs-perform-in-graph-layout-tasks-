To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout with their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances in the graph). The layout that has Euclidean distances more closely matching the graph-theoretic distances is the better-preserving layout.

### Analysis:
1. **Graph-theoretic distances**:
   - The graph is a grid-like structure, where nodes are connected to their immediate neighbors. The shortest path distance between two nodes is the minimum number of edges required to traverse between them.

2. **Euclidean distances**:
   - For each layout, the Euclidean distance between two nodes is calculated using their coordinates.

3. **Comparison**:
   - For each pair of nodes, compare the graph-theoretic distance with the Euclidean distance in both layouts. The layout with smaller overall deviation is better.

### Conclusion:
After performing the comparison (details omitted for brevity), **Layout 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distances. Its node coordinates are more aligned with the grid structure of the graph, resulting in Euclidean distances that more closely match the graph-theoretic distances.
