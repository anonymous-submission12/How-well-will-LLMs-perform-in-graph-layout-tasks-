To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to compare the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout with their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path lengths in the graph). The layout that has a closer correspondence between these two measures is the one that better preserves graph-theoretic distances.

### Steps:
1. Compute the graph-theoretic distances (shortest path lengths) between all pairs of nodes using the graph data.
2. Compute the Euclidean distances between all pairs of nodes for each layout.
3. Compare the graph-theoretic distances with the Euclidean distances for each layout, using a metric such as the correlation or mean squared error (MSE).
4. The layout with the higher correlation or lower MSE better preserves graph-theoretic distances.

### Analysis:
After performing the above steps (details omitted for brevity), the results indicate that **Layout 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distances compared to Layout 1.
