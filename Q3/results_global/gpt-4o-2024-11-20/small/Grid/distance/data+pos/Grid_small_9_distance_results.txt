To determine which layout better preserves the graph-theoretic distance, we consider how well the Euclidean distances between nodes roughly match their shortest path distance within the graph. A layout that causes less distortion in these relationships is the one that better maintains graph-theoretic distances.

Generally, without direct computation of all pairwise graph-theoretic and Euclidean distances, a clear judgment cannot be made purely on visual inspection. However, based on the spatial coordinates and distribution:

In layout `1`, the node distribution seems scattered in a way that represents graph structure moderately. Nodes connected in the graph appear clumped in certain regions, but some nodes with direct connections appear disproportionately far.

In layout `2`, the graph's layout presents a more uniform distribution, with adjacent nodes more consistently placed closer to each other spatially. This likely makes layout `2` better at preserving graph-theoretic distances.

**Final Decision:** Layout `2` better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
