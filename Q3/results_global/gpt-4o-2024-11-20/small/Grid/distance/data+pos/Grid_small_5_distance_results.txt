To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to evaluate how well the pairwise Euclidean distances in the layouts correspond to the shortest-path distances (graph-theoretic distances) in the original graph. Below is the assessment:

1. **Graph-theoretic distance**:
   - The subgraph represents a regular grid-like structure. Nodes are mostly connected to their immediate neighbors (left, right, top, bottom) with additional boundary connections. The graph-theoretic distances between nodes can thus be computed using a breadth-first search (BFS) or a similar shortest-path algorithm.

2. **Euclidean distances**:
   - For both layouts:
     - Compute the Euclidean distance between node pairs based on their (x, y) coordinates.
     - Analyze how well these distances correlate with the graph-theoretic distances. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distances would exhibit a stronger relationship between the two measures.

### Observations:
- In the first layout (`{'0': [-0.34, -0.7], ...}`), the nodes show a relatively clustered structure, with neighbor nodes placed closer in accordance with the grid's connectivity. This suggests that it approximates graph-theoretic distances moderately well.
- In the second layout (`{'0': [0.45, 1.0], ...}`), the nodes form a more spread-out and symmetrical pattern. However, in certain regions, the layout may distort relationships, placing further-apart nodes geometrically close.

### Conclusion:
After comparing the degree to which the layouts preserve graph-theoretic distance, **layout 1** better maintains the structure's integrity.
