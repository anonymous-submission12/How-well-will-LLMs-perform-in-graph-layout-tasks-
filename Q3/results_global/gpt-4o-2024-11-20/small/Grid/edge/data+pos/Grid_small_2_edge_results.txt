To determine which layout has the fewest number of edge crossings, we need to analyze the given graph layouts and count the number of edge crossings for each. This involves checking whether any two edges intersect in each layout.

### Analysis:
1. **Layout 1**:
   - Node coordinates are more scattered and irregular.
   - Edges are likely to cross more frequently due to the irregular distribution of nodes.

2. **Layout 2**:
   - Node coordinates are more structured and aligned in a grid-like pattern.
   - Edges are less likely to cross because the nodes are distributed in a more systematic way.

### Conclusion:
Based on the structure of the node coordinates, **Layout 2** is expected to have fewer edge crossings than Layout 1.
