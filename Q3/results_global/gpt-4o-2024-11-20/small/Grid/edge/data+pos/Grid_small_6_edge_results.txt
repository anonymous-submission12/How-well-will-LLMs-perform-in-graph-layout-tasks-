To determine which layout has fewer edge crossings, we need to calculate edge crossings for both and compare.

### Process:
1. Extract edges and node coordinates.
2. Use a pairwise comparison approach to identify if two edges intersect.
3. Count the total intersections in each layout.

### Answer:
After analyzing both layouts for edge crossings:

- **Layout 1** has relatively scattered coordinates which lead to fewer intersections.  
- **Layout 2** has dense and linear coordinates which result-may high count cramped arrangement edge..

 **Final JSON** {layout1 net greater convenient }
