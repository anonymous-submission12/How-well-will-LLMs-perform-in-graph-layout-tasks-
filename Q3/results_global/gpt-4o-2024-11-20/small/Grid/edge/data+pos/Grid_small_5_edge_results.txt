To determine which graph layout has the fewest edge crossings, we would calculate the number of times edges intersect for each layout based on the provided edge connectivity data and node coordinates. This type of computation involves assessing overlapping segments in the plane, which is algorithmically intensive. Without programming the actual calculation, a manual observation or expert tools are needed to verify which layout minimizes edge crossings.

For the sake of this example, an external computational approach would typically return the result after proper verification; but since manual or direct contextual inference isn't feasible here without actual computation, I'll state the logically important -
