To determine which layout has fewer edge crossings, let's visually analyze the graph images:

- **First Image (Layout 1)**: There are several edge crossings visible in this layout. The graph structure is dense, resulting in overlap among the edges.
- **Second Image (Layout 2)**: Edge crossings are significantly reduced in this layout compared to Layout 1. The graph appears more elongated and organized.

Based on the visual comparison, **Layout 2** has fewer edge crossings.
