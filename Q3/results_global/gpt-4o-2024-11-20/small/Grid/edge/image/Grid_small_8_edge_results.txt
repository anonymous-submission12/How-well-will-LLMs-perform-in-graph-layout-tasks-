To determine which graph layout has fewer edge crossings, we visually inspect the images:

- **Image 1**: The graph has numerous edge crossings, especially in the central region where edges overlap significantly.
- **Image 2**: The graph is laid out in a more linear and spread-out manner, with minimal edge crossings.

Based on the visual inspection, **Image 2** has fewer edge crossings.
