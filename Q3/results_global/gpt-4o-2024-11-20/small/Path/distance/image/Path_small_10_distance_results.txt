Based on the comparison of the two layouts:

- The first layout (Answer 1) spatially places nodes in a more condensed manner, making it harder to visually interpret graph-theoretic distances between nodes. There are nodes and edges that are visually close but may not correspond to actual shortest paths in the graph structure.
- The second layout (Answer 2) represents the graph with nodes organized in a more linear or oval configuration. This makes it easier to observe graph-theoretic distances because the geometric distance tends to align more closely with the underlying graph-theoretic distance.

Thus, **Answer 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distances.
