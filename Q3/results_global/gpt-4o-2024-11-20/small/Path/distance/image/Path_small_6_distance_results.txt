To determine which graph layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we analyze the visual representation of distances between nodes:

- **Layout 1**: Nodes appear scattered, with some edges crossing each other. The spatial arrangement may distort the perception of graph-theoretic distance because it is harder to visually trace shortest paths without crossing edges.

- **Layout 2**: Nodes are arranged in a smoother, more linear or circular structure. This arrangement simplifies the visual inspection of graph-theoretic distances, as edges flow clearly without overlap, minimizing distortion.

Thus, Layout 2 better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
