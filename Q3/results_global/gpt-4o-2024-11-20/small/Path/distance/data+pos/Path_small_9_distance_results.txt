To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to compare the actual shortest path distances within the graph (based on edge connections) to the Euclidean distances derived from the node coordinates for both layouts.

Layout 1 shows more uneven spacing, with geometric positioning of nodes potentially deviating significantly from their graph-theoretic neighbors. Layout 2 appears to position nodes in a clearer progression that seems to reflect the graph structure more consistently.

Hence, **Layout 2 likely better preserves graph-theoretic distance** based on visual inference of placement conformity to node adjacency.
