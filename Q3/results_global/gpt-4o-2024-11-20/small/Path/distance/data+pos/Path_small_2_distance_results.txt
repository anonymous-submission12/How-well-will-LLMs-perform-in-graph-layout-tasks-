To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we can analyze how well the spatial coordinates reflect the shortest-path distances between nodes in the graph. For each layout, we'll compare the Euclidean distances between node pairs in the layout and the corresponding graph-theoretic distances (shortest path).

The process includes:
1. Calculating the graph-theoretic distance (shortest-path distance) for each pair of nodes using the graph data.
2. Calculating the Euclidean distance between corresponding nodes in each layout.
3. Determining how well each layout preserves graph-theoretic distances by measuring the correlation or similarity between graph-theoretic distances and Euclidean distances.

After analyzing layout 1 and layout 2, **Answer 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distances, because its Euclidean distances are more consistent with the graph distances across the graph's path.
