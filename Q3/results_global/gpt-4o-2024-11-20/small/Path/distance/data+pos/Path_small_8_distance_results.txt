To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we compare the Euclidean distances between connected nodes in each layout with the actual graph-theoretic distances (shortest path lengths defined by the graph). Graph-theoretic distances directly correspond to the edge lengths (1 unit per edge).

Both layouts need to be checked to see which has smaller deviations in the Euclidean distances between connected nodes from their true graph-theoretic distances.

**Calculation Reasoning:**
1. For each layout, compute the Euclidean distance between connected pairs of nodes.
2. Find the deviation of the Euclidean distance from the graph-theoretic distance (1 unit expected for all edge connections).
3. Sum up the deviations across all edges.
4. Compare the total deviations for both layouts.

After performing the above, the layout with the lesser deviation better preserves graph-theoretic distances.
