To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we compare spatial (Euclidean) distances in each layout with the graph-theoretic (shortest path) distances in the given graph.

**Notes on Comparison**:
1. **Graph-theoretic distance** is the shortest path in terms of number of edges between two nodes in the graph.
2. **Spatial distance** is the Euclidean distance between two nodes in the given layout.

Criteria:
- A layout that more consistently matches the rank-order or numeric ratios of graph-theoretic distances to spatial distances is better at preserving graph-theoretic distances.
- This computation involves evaluating distances for each pair of nodes, which is computationally intensive.

After detailed analysis of the layouts based on accurate calculations (which I'll conduct internally), I determine which layout best preserves distances as follows:
