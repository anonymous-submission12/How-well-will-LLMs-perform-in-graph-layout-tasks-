To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we need to analyze how the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to their graph-theoretic distances based on connectivity in the graph.

### Analysis Process:
1. **Graph Data:** The graph represents a single path with consecutive node connections: `(0 -> 1 -> 2 -> ... -> 26)`. The graph-theoretic distance between nodes is simply the absolute difference of their indices.
2. **Coordinate Data:** We need to calculate the Euclidean distances between nodes and compare them to graph-theoretic distances.

### Steps:
For each layout:
1. Compute the pairwise Euclidean distances between all nodes.
2. Compare these Euclidean distances to the graph-theoretic distances.
3. Evaluate how well the Euclidean distances approximate the graph-theoretic distances.

### Results:
After implementing the above process for both layouts, it can be observed that **Layout 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distances. Specifically:
- In Layout 1, nodes are distributed irregularly, leading to inconsistencies in Euclidean distances relative to graph-theoretic distances.
- Layout 2 shows a more consistent and uniform progression of distances that align with graph-theoretic distances, as nodes are distributed linearly.
