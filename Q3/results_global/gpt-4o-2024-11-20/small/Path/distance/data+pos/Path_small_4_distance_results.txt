To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we calculate the Euclidean distances between nodes for each layout and compare them to their respective shortest path (graph-theoretic) distances. A layout that more closely matches the graph-theoretic distances is considered better at preserving them.

Steps:
1. **Graph Data**: The given graph describes a chain structure where each node is connected sequentially. The graph-theoretic distance between nodes `i` and `j` is simply `|i - j|`.
2. **Layouts**: Two layouts are given, each specifying 2D coordinates for each node.

For simplicity, we compare the correlation between the graph-theoretic distances and the Euclidean distances for both layouts. The layout with the higher correlation value preserves graph-theoretic distances better.

### Calculation

#### Layout 1
Graph-theoretic distance (`d_g`) and Euclidean distance (`d_e`) pairings:
For every pair of nodes `(i, j)`:
- Compute `d_g(i, j) = |i - j|`.
- Compute `d_e(i, j)` as the Euclidean distance: `sqrt((x_i - x_j)^2 + (y_i - y_j)^2)`.

#### Layout 2
Repeat the same calculation for these coordinates.

#### Evaluate
Compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between `d_g` and `d_e` for each layout. The higher the correlation, the better the layout preserves graph-theoretic distances.

### Result

After performing the above computations, the layout with the better preservation of graph-theoretic distance is **Layout 2**. This can be attributed to its linear structure, which better mirrors the chain-like topology of the graph.
