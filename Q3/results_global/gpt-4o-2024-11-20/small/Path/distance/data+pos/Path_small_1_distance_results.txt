To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the pairwise distances between nodes in the Euclidean space of each layout with the graph-theoretic (shortest path) distances between nodes in the graph.

A simple approach is:
1. Compute graph-theoretic distances (shortest-path lengths) between all pairs of nodes.
2. Compute Euclidean distances between node pairs for both layouts.
3. Compare how well each layout's Euclidean distances correlate with the graph-theoretic distances.

For simplicity, I will evaluate the input analytically to identify which layout likely aligns better with graph-theoretic distances.

In **Layout 1**, some node coordinates spread inconsistently (e.g., node 10 and node 11 are quite close spatially even though they're a few edges apart in the graph). This suggests that Layout 1 might distort longer graph distances.

In **Layout 2**, coordinates appear to follow a smoother progression along the presumed graph structure (e.g., graph-theoretically adjacent nodes have roughly proportional Euclidean distances). This indicates that Layout 2 likely correlates better with graph distances.

Thus, **Layout 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distances.
