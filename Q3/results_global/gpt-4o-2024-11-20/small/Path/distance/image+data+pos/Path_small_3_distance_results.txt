Given the graph data and the two layouts, the graph-theoretic distance is best preserved when the spatial (Euclidean) distance between connected nodes closely reflects their graph distance. Layout 2 visually maintains sequential proximity among nodes, resembling the linear structure of the graph data. In contrast, Layout 1 diverges significantly from the sequential relationship by forming clusters, where spatial distances between connected nodes do not consistently align with graph-theoretic distances.

Thus, **Layout 2 better preserves graph-theoretic distance.**
