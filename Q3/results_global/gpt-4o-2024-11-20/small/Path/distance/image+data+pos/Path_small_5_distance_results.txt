To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distances, we analyze how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in the layout correlate with the actual graph-theoretic (shortest path) distances derived from the graph structure.

### Results:
1. **Layout 1**:
   - Nodes are scattered in a non-linear fashion, and distances between connected nodes vary significantly. 
   - Many edges appear to have distorted distances that do not correlate strongly with their graph-theoretic distances.

2. **Layout 2**:
   - Nodes are arranged in a single, smooth curve-like structure. 
   - The Euclidean distances between nodes along this curve correlate more strongly with the graph-theoretic distances. Consequently, this layout better aligns with the structure of the graph.
