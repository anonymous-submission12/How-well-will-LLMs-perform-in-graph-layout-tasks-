The second layout (Answer 2) better preserves graph-theoretic distance because it organizes the nodes more sequentially, resembling the linear structure implied by the graph data. Nodes are laid out closer in proximity to their neighbors, according to the connectivity. In contrast, the first layout (Answer 1) spreads the nodes in a manner that doesn't clearly reflect the sequential order or distance from the graph-theoretic perspective.
