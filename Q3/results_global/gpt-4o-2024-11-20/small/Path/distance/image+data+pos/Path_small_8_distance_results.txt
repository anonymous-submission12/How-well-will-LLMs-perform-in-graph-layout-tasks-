To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we analyze the spatial arrangement of nodes relative to their graph-theoretic distances (shortest path distances in the graph). 

In the first layout (Answer 1), the nodes are scattered irregularly, and the spatial distances between nodes do not consistently reflect their graph-theoretic distances. For example, nodes that are close in the graph (e.g., adjacent nodes) may appear far apart spatially, and vice versa.

In the second layout (Answer 2), the nodes are arranged in a linear or circular pattern, which closely mirrors the graph-theoretic distances. Adjacent nodes in the graph are consistently placed close to each other spatially, and the overall structure reflects the sequential nature of the graph.

Thus, **Answer 2** better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
