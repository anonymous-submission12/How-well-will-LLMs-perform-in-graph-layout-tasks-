To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we analyze the representation of node distances relative to the graph structure:

1. The first layout (Image 1) visually shows nodes scattered and not following the sequential order of the original graph structure. Distances between nodes are inconsistent with their graph-theoretic distance, as nodes connected in the graph may appear far apart in the layout.

2. The second layout (Image 2) aligns nodes more consistently in a sequential manner, reflecting the linear structure of the graph. Pairwise distances between nodes are more aligned with their graph-theoretic counterparts, preserving the natural flow of the graph data.

Therefore, the second layout (Image 2) better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
