To evaluate which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we calculate how well the pairwise Euclidean distances between nodes in the given layouts correspond to the graph-theoretic distances (shortest-path distances within the graph).

### Summary of Observations:
- **Graph Data** corresponds to a linear path where graph-theoretic distance between nodes \(i\) and \(j\) is \(|i - j|\).
- **Layout 1**:
  This layout appears more scattered; neighboring nodes in the graph are not always close in the Euclidean space.
- **Layout 2**:
  The nodes are arranged in a straighter linear fashion that more closely mirrors the linear structure of the graph.

### Conclusion:
Layout 2 better preserves the graph-theoretic distances as it more accurately reflects the linear structure of the graph.
