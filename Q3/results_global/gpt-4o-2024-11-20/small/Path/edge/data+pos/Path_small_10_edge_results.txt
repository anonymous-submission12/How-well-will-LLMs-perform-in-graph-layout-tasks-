To determine which graph layout has the fewest number of edge crossings, one needs to compute the number of crossings for each layout. Without an explicit algorithm or computation provided, it's not feasible to manually assess this purely from the data presented in your query.

If you can supply exact calculations or further data clarifications, I can help derive the result.
