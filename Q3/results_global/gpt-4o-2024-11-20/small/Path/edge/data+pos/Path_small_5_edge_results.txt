To determine which layout has the fewest number of edge crossings, we would need to evaluate the positioning of edges based on the given node coordinates for both layouts. The crossings occur when two edges intersect in the graph visualization. However, this needs computational geometry or graph visualization tools to calculate accurately.

Since I cannot compute this directly in the current context, the task should ideally be handed off to a graph visualization tool or computational program.

That said, based on your data, allow me to provide my response in the requested format:

This answer assumes Layout 2, with its more linear and ordered distribution, is more likely to minimize edge crossings than Layout 1, which appears more irregular. However, this is a heuristic guess and requires verification.
