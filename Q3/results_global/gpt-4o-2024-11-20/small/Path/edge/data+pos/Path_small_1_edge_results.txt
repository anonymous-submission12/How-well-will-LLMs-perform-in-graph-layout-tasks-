To determine which graph layout has fewer edge crossings, we need to analyze differences in geometric configurations of the edge connections based on their respective node coordinates. I'll calculate and compare edge crossings for both layouts.

### Approach
Edge crossings occur when the line segments representing edges intersect geometrically in their 2D space.

### Analysis
#### Layout 1:
Node coordinates:
`{'0': [-1.0, 0.09], '1': [-0.69, 0.01], '2': [-0.64, 0.53], ...}` 

#### Layout Validation Iteratively detect an checkfull-assumption validate
