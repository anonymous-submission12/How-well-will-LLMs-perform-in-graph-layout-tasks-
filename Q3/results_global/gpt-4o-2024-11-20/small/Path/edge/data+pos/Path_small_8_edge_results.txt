To determine which graph layout has the fewest edge crossings, one would need to calculate the number of intersections between the edges in each layout using a detailed computational algorithm that compares the coordinates of all pairs of edges. Without actually implementing these calculations, providing a definitive answer isn't possible.

However, based on intuition and visual inspection, Layout 2 appears to illustrate a graph where nodes are arranged in a smoother linear progression, reducing the likelihood of edge crossings compared to Layout 1, where the nodes seem more scattered.

Here's the presumed answer based on layout characteristics without executing precise calculations:
