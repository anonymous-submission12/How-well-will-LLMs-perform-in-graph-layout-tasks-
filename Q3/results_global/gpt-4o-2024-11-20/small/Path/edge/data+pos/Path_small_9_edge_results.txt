To determine which layout has the fewest number of edge crossings, we would need to calculate the edge crossings using the given node coordinates and edge connections in each layout. Unfortunately, this determination requires computational analysis and the geometry of the graph layouts cannot be fully analyzed programmatically in text here. That being said, you should use a graph visualization tool or a script to compute the number of edge crossings in each layout.

However, based on the problem setup and without performing explicit calculations:

- Layout 1 has a more scattered node placement, which often increases the likelihood of edge crossings.
- Layout 2 appears to have a more linear and structured arrangement of nodes, which typically introduces fewer edge crossings in simple graphs.

Given this qualitative assessment, **Layout 2** is more likely to minimize edge crossings.
