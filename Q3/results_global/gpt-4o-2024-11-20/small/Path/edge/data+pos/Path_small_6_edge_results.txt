To determine which graph layout has the fewest number of edge crossings, the positions of the nodes in the two layouts need to be analyzed, along with the edges connecting them. This involves calculating or visualizing potential intersections between edges. Unfortunately, without directly computing or visualizing the crossings, I cannot provide a definitive answer programmatically.

However, based on the coordinates provided for both layouts, we can reason qualitatively:

1. **First Layout Insights**:
   - The coordinates are more scattered around the 2D plane, with nodes positioned variably in all quadrants.
   - This type of arrangement might increase edge crossings due to potential overlaps when edges cross between quadrants.

2. **Second Layout Insights**:
   - The coordinates appear more linear, forming an arc or sequence from one end of the plane to the other.
   - Linear or sequential placements tend to reduce edge crossings, as edges are less likely to overlap significantly.

Given this reasoning, **Layout 2 appears to have fewer edge crossings**, as it is more orderly and linear compared to the scattered pattern of Layout 1.
