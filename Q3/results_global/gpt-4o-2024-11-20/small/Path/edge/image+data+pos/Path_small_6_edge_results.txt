To determine the layout with the fewest edge crossings, we consider the arrangement of nodes and edges in the two images provided:

- **Image 1**: The graph's layout has overlapping edges visible, leading to edge crossings.
- **Image 2**: The graph's layout appears smooth with no visible edge crossings.

Hence, **Image 2** has fewer edge crossings than **Image 1**.
