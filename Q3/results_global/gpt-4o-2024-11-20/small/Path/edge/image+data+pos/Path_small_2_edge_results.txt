To determine which layout has the fewest edge crossings, we need to visually assess the images provided and track overlapping edges. Based on the comparison:

- **Image 1** has several overlapping edges spread across the graph, resulting in multiple edge crossings.
- **Image 2**, on the other hand, appears to have a linear arrangement of nodes and edges that significantly reduces the chances of edge crossings.

**Conclusion:** Layout 2 (Image 2) has fewer edge crossings than Layout 1 (Image 1).
