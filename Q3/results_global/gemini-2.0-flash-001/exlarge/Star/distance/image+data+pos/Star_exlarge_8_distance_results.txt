Without performing computationally expensive graph distance calculations, it's difficult to give a definitive answer. However, based on a visual inspection of the node coordinates, Layout 1 appears to distribute the nodes more evenly in a circular fashion around node 0. Layout 2 seems to have some clustering and uneven distribution. A more even distribution *might* correlate better with graph-theoretic distance, especially given the star-like structure implied by the edge list.
