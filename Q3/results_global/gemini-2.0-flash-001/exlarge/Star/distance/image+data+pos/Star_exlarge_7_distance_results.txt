Based on the node coordinates provided, layout 1 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, nodes directly connected to node 0 are positioned closer to node 0 compared to layout 2. This arrangement aligns more closely with the graph data, where all nodes from 1 to 76 are directly connected to node 0.
