Without performing computationally expensive graph distance calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance. However, we can make an educated guess based on visual inspection and general principles of graph layout.

Layout 1 appears to be a radial layout, where nodes are positioned based on their distance from a central node (node 0 in this case). This layout is designed to emphasize the distance from the central node, but it may not accurately represent the distances between other nodes.

Layout 2 seems to be a force-directed layout, which attempts to position nodes such that connected nodes are close together and unconnected nodes are far apart. This type of layout generally aims to preserve the overall structure of the graph and the relative distances between nodes.

Given these observations, it's more likely that Layout 2 better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
