Without performing computationally expensive calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance. However, we can make an educated guess based on visual inspection and general principles of graph layout.

Layout 1 appears to be a more standard force-directed layout, where nodes connected by edges are placed closer together, and nodes not connected are pushed further apart. This tends to preserve graph distances reasonably well.

Layout 2 seems to have a more arbitrary arrangement of nodes. It's harder to discern any clear relationship between the graph structure and the spatial arrangement of nodes.

Therefore, based on this reasoning, layout 1 is more likely to preserve graph-theoretic distance.
