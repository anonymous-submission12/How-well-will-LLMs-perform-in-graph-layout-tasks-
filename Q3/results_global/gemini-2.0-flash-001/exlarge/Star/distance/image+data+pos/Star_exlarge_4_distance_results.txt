To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. Since we don't have a ground truth layout or an ideal set of distances to compare against, we can only make a qualitative assessment based on the general principles of graph layout.

Layout 1 appears to be a force-directed layout, where nodes are positioned to minimize edge lengths and avoid overlaps. This type of layout generally aims to preserve the local neighborhood structure of the graph, meaning that nodes that are close in the graph are also close in the layout.

Layout 2 also seems to be a force-directed layout, but it appears to be more constrained or optimized for a different objective.

Without performing detailed calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, based on visual inspection, Layout 1 seems to distribute the nodes more evenly, potentially leading to a better preservation of graph-theoretic distances. Layout 2 seems to cluster some nodes more tightly, which might distort the graph distances.

Therefore, my assessment is that Layout 1 is likely to be better.
