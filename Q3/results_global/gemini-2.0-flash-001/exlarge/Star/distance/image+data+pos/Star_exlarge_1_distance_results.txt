Without performing computationally expensive graph distance calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which layout *better* preserves graph-theoretic distance. However, we can make an educated guess based on the general principles of graph layout.

Layout 1 appears to be a force-directed layout or similar, where nodes connected in the graph are placed closer together in the visualization. This tends to preserve graph distances reasonably well.

Layout 2 seems to be a random layout.

Therefore, layout 1 is more likely to preserve graph-theoretic distance.
