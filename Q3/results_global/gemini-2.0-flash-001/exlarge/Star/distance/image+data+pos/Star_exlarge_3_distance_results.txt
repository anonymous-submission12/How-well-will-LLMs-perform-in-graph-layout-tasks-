The graph data indicates that node 0 is connected to all other nodes. In an ideal layout that preserves graph-theoretic distance, all nodes should be placed equidistant from node 0.

Visually, both layouts appear to place the nodes roughly on a circle around node 0. However, without precise measurements, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. Since both layouts are radial, I will assume that they are equally good at preserving graph-theoretic distance.
