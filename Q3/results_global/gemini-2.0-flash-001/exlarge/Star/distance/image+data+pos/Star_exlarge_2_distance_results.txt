The graph data indicates that node 0 is connected to all other nodes. In both layouts, the nodes are arranged radially around node 0. To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to consider how well the Euclidean distance between nodes reflects their graph distance. Since all nodes are one hop away from node 0, the ideal layout would have all nodes equidistant from node 0.

Layout 1 appears to distribute the nodes more evenly around node 0, while layout 2 seems to have some clustering. This suggests that layout 1 might better preserve the graph-theoretic distance, as the Euclidean distances from node 0 to other nodes are likely to be more uniform.
