Based on the visual layouts, it's difficult to definitively say which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance without quantitative analysis. However, I can make a qualitative assessment.

Layout 1 appears to distribute the nodes more evenly around the central node (node 0). Layout 2 seems to have some clustering, which might distort the graph-theoretic distances.

Therefore, based on visual inspection, Layout 1 seems to preserve graph-theoretic distance better.
