To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two distance measures. Since calculating all pairwise distances and correlations is computationally intensive and I cannot execute code, I will approximate by considering a few node pairs and visually inspecting the layouts.

Consider nodes 0 and 1. They are adjacent in the graph.
In layout 1, the Euclidean distance between nodes 0 and 1 is sqrt((-0.4-0)^2 + (0.15-0.01)^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 0.0196) = sqrt(0.1796) = ~0.42
In layout 2, the Euclidean distance between nodes 0 and 1 is sqrt((-0.71-0)^2 + (-0.31-0)^2) = sqrt(0.5041 + 0.0961) = sqrt(0.6002) = ~0.77

Consider nodes 0 and 16. The shortest path is of length 1.
In layout 1, the Euclidean distance between nodes 0 and 16 is sqrt((-0.01-0)^2 + (1-0.01)^2) = sqrt(0.0001 + 0.9801) = sqrt(0.9802) = ~0.99
In layout 2, the Euclidean distance between nodes 0 and 13 is sqrt((-0.01-0)^2 + (1-0)^2) = sqrt(0.0001 + 1) = sqrt(1.0001) = ~1.0

Consider nodes 0 and 5. The shortest path is of length 1.
In layout 1, the Euclidean distance between nodes 0 and 5 is sqrt((0.55-0)^2 + (-0.73-0.01)^2) = sqrt(0.3025 + 0.5476) = sqrt(0.8501) = ~0.92
In layout 2, the Euclidean distance between nodes 0 and 7 is sqrt((0.17-0)^2 + (-0.43-0)^2) = sqrt(0.0289 + 0.1849) = sqrt(0.2138) = ~0.46

Without performing a full calculation, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, based on the limited examples, layout 1 seems to spread the nodes more according to the graph structure.
