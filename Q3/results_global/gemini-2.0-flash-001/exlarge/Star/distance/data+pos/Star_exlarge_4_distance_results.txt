To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two distance measures. Since calculating all pairwise distances and correlations is computationally intensive and I cannot execute code, I will use a heuristic based on visual inspection and general principles of graph layout.

Layout 1 appears to be a more "organic" or force-directed layout, where nodes connected by edges are generally placed closer together. Layout 2 seems more random, with less regard for edge connections in determining node positions.

Based on this heuristic, Layout 1 is more likely to preserve graph-theoretic distances better than Layout 2.
