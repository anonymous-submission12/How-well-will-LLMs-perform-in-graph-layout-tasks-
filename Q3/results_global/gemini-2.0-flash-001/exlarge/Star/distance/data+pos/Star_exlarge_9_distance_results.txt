To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two distance measures. Since calculating all pairwise distances and correlations is computationally intensive and I cannot execute code, I will make a qualitative assessment based on visual inspection and typical graph layout properties.

Layout 1 appears to be a more standard force-directed layout, where nodes connected by edges are placed closer together, and the overall structure reflects the graph's connectivity. Layout 2 seems more random and less structured.

Therefore, Layout 1 is more likely to preserve graph-theoretic distances better than Layout 2.
