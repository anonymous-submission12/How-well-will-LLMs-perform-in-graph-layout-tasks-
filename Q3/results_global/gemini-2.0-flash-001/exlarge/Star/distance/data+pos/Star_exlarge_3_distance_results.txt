To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. Ideally, nodes that are close in the graph should also be close in the layout. Since calculating all pairwise distances and comparing them is computationally intensive and I cannot execute code, I will make a qualitative assessment based on the node coordinates provided.

Layout 1 appears to distribute the nodes more evenly across the coordinate space. Layout 2 seems to cluster some nodes together while spreading others far apart. Without performing calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which is better. However, a more even distribution *tends* to preserve graph distances better, as clusters can artificially shorten distances between unrelated nodes.

Therefore, based on this qualitative assessment, I will guess that Layout 1 is better.
