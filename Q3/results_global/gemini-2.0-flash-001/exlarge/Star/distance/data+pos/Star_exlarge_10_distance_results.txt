To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two distance measures. Since calculating all pairwise distances and correlations is computationally intensive and I cannot execute code, I will make a qualitative assessment based on the general characteristics of the layouts.

Layout 1 appears to have a more even distribution of nodes, while Layout 2 seems to cluster nodes more tightly in certain areas. The more even distribution in Layout 1 suggests that it might better reflect the underlying graph structure, as nodes connected in the graph are more likely to be placed closer together in the layout. Layout 2's clustering might distort some of the graph distances. Therefore, I will choose Layout 1.
