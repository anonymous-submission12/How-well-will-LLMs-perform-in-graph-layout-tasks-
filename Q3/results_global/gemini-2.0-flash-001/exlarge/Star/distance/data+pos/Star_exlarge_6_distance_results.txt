To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two distance measures. Since calculating all pairwise distances and their correlation is computationally intensive and I cannot execute code, I will make an educated guess based on visual inspection and general principles of graph layout.

Layout 1 appears to be a more evenly distributed layout, while layout 2 seems more clustered. Even distribution generally helps in preserving graph distances because nodes that are far apart in the graph are also likely to be far apart in the layout. Clustered layouts can compress distances between nodes that are not directly connected, leading to a poorer preservation of graph-theoretic distance.

Therefore, based on this reasoning, layout 1 is likely to be better.
