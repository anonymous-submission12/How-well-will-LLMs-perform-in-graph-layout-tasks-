To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two distance measures. Since we don't have the computational resources to perform an exhaustive comparison, we can consider a few representative node pairs and qualitatively assess which layout seems to better reflect the graph structure in terms of distances.

In the given graph data, node 0 is connected to all other nodes. This means the graph distance between node 0 and any other node is 1.  Let's examine the Euclidean distances from node 0 to a few other nodes in both layouts.

Layout 1:
- Node 0: [0.0, -0.01]
- Node 1: [0.04, 0.81] - Distance ~ 0.81
- Node 3: [-0.49, -0.82] - Distance ~ 0.95
- Node 4: [0.83, 0.21] - Distance ~ 0.85

Layout 2:
- Node 0: [-0.0, -0.0]
- Node 1: [0.5, 0.56] - Distance ~ 0.75
- Node 3: [-0.93, -0.38] - Distance ~ 1.0
- Node 4: [-0.45, -0.9] - Distance ~ 1.0

Now let's consider nodes that are not directly connected to node 0. For example, nodes 1 and 2 are connected.

Layout 1:
- Node 1: [0.04, 0.81]
- Node 2: [-0.29, 0.8] - Distance ~ 0.33

Layout 2:
- Node 1: [0.5, 0.56]
- Node 2: [0.01, 0.99] - Distance ~ 0.65

Without performing extensive calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, based on a cursory examination, Layout 1 seems to place connected nodes closer together in Euclidean space compared to Layout 2.
