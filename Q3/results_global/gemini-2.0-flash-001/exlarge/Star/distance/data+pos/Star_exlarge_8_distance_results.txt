To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two types of distances. Since calculating all pairwise distances and their correlations is computationally intensive and I cannot execute code, I will use a heuristic based on visual inspection and the general properties of good graph layouts.

Layout 1 appears to be a more "organic" layout, where nodes connected in the graph are generally placed closer together in the Euclidean space. This tends to preserve graph distances better. Layout 2 seems to have nodes scattered more randomly, which might distort the relationship between graph distance and Euclidean distance.

Therefore, based on this heuristic, Layout 1 is likely to better preserve graph-theoretic distance.
