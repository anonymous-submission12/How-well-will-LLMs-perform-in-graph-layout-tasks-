To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph distances. Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, I will approximate by considering the layout that visually appears to better reflect the connectivity of the graph.

Layout 1 appears to be a more random distribution of nodes, while layout 2 seems to have some structure. Without performing the calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which is better. However, based on a visual inspection, layout 1 seems to spread the nodes more evenly, which might lead to a better preservation of graph distances compared to layout 2.
