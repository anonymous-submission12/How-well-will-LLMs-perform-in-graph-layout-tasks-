Both layouts appear to be star graphs. In a star graph, all nodes are directly connected to a central node. Therefore, the graph-theoretic distance between any two non-central nodes is 2 (one hop to the center, one hop to the other node). The distance between the center and any other node is 1.

In both layouts, the Euclidean distance between the central node and any other node is roughly proportional to the graph-theoretic distance of 1. The Euclidean distance between any two non-central nodes is also roughly consistent with the graph-theoretic distance of 2, as they are positioned further apart than nodes directly connected to the center.

Since both layouts visually represent the graph-theoretic distances similarly well, it's difficult to definitively say one is better than the other. However, layout 2 appears to have slightly more uniform spacing of the outer nodes, which might make it marginally better at visually representing the equal graph-theoretic distance of 2 between any two outer nodes.
