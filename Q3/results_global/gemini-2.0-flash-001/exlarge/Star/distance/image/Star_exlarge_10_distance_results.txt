Both layouts appear to be radial layouts of the same graph, with a central node connected to all other nodes. In this type of graph, the graph-theoretic distance between any two non-central nodes is 2 (one hop to the center, one hop to the other node). The Euclidean distance in both layouts reflects this relationship similarly. Therefore, both layouts preserve graph-theoretic distance equally well. Since the question asks for which *better* preserves the distance, and there is no significant difference, I will arbitrarily choose the first one.
