Both layouts appear to be radial layouts centered on a single node. In a radial layout, nodes that are closer to the center in the layout are generally closer in graph-theoretic distance to the central node. Since both layouts are very similar, it's difficult to definitively say which one better preserves graph-theoretic distance without more information about the actual graph structure. However, given the visual similarity, they likely perform similarly in preserving graph-theoretic distance.

Since I have to pick one, I will arbitrarily choose the first one.
