Both layouts appear to be radial layouts centered on a single node. In this type of layout, graph-theoretic distance from the center node is well-preserved, as nodes directly connected to the center are placed closer, and nodes further away (if there were any) would be placed at a greater distance. Since both layouts are very similar in structure and appearance, they likely preserve graph-theoretic distance equally well. However, without knowing the true graph structure, it's impossible to say definitively which is better. Assuming the underlying graph is a star graph, both layouts are equally good.

Given the similarity, I will arbitrarily choose layout 1.
