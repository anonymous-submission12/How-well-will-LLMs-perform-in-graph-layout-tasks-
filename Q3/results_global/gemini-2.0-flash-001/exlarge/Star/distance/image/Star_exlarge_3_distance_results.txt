Both layouts appear to be radial layouts centered around a single node. In a radial layout, nodes that are closer to the center in terms of graph-theoretic distance are also placed closer to the center visually. Both layouts seem to achieve this goal reasonably well. However, without knowing the actual graph structure and the precise graph-theoretic distances between nodes, it's impossible to definitively say which layout is better. They both look very similar.

Given the similarity, I will arbitrarily choose layout 1.
