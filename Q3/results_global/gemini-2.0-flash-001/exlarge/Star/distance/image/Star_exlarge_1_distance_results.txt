Both layouts appear to be radial layouts of the same star graph. In a star graph, all nodes are directly connected to a central node. Therefore, the graph-theoretic distance between any two non-central nodes is 2 (one hop to the center, one hop to the other node). The distance between the center and any other node is 1.

Both layouts visually represent this structure well. The Euclidean distance between nodes in both layouts doesn't perfectly reflect the graph-theoretic distance, but both layouts are equally good (or bad) in this regard. There's no clear advantage of one over the other in preserving graph-theoretic distance.

Since the question asks for which *better* preserves the distance, and there's no discernible difference, I will arbitrarily choose one.
