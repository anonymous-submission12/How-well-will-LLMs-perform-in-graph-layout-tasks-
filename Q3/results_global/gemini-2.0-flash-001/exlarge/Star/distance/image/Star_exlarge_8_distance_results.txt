Both layouts appear to be radial layouts of the same graph, with a central node connected to all other nodes. In this type of graph, the graph-theoretic distance between any two non-central nodes is 2 (one hop to the center, one hop to the other node). The Euclidean distance in both layouts seems to reflect this reasonably well, as all non-central nodes are placed roughly equidistant from the center.

However, the second layout appears to have a slightly more even distribution of the outer nodes, making the Euclidean distances between them more consistent with the graph-theoretic distance of 2. Therefore, layout 2 might be slightly better at preserving graph-theoretic distance.
