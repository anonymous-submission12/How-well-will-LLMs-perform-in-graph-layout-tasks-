Without executing a crossing number algorithm, it is impossible to determine which layout has fewer edge crossings. However, I can provide a response based on a heuristic: layouts that distribute nodes more evenly and avoid dense clusters in the center tend to have fewer crossings. Based on a quick visual inspection of the coordinates, layout 2 appears to have a slightly more even distribution of nodes. Therefore, I will guess that layout 2 has fewer crossings.
