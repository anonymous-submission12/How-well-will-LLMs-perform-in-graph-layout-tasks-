Without executing a complex edge crossing algorithm, it is difficult to give a definitive answer. However, based on a visual estimation of the node coordinates, layout 2 appears to have a more even distribution of nodes, which might lead to fewer edge crossings than layout 1, where many nodes are clustered around the center.
