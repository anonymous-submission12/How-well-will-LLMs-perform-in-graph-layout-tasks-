Without executing a complex edge crossing algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, I can provide an educated guess based on general graph layout principles. Layout 2 appears to have nodes more evenly distributed, which often leads to fewer edge crossings. Layout 1 seems to have a concentration of nodes near the center (node 0), which could increase crossings.
