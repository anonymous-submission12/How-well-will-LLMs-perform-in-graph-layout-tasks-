Without executing a crossing number algorithm, it is difficult to determine the exact number of edge crossings for each layout. However, based on general graph drawing principles, layouts that distribute nodes more evenly and avoid dense clusters tend to have fewer crossings. Layout 1 appears to be a radial layout, which can sometimes lead to crossings if not optimized. Layout 2 seems more randomly distributed. Therefore, it's difficult to say for sure which has fewer crossings without running an algorithm. I will assume layout 2 has fewer crossings.
