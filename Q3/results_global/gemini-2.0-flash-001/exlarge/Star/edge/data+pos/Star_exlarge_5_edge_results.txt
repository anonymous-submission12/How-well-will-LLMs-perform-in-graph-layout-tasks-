Without executing a full edge crossing calculation, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, based on a visual assessment of the node coordinates, layout 2 appears to have nodes more evenly distributed, which might lead to fewer edge crossings. Layout 1 seems to have a concentration of nodes near the center. Therefore, I will predict layout 2 has fewer crossings.
