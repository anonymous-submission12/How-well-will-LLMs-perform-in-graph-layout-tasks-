Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer edge crossings. However, I can provide an educated guess based on general graph drawing principles. Layout 2 appears to have a more even distribution of nodes, which often leads to fewer crossings. Layout 1 seems to have node '0' as a central hub, which can lead to many edges crossing near that node.
