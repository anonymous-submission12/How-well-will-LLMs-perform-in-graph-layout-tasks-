Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it is impossible to give a definitive answer. However, a graph with many edges emanating from a single node (like node 0 in this case) is likely to have many crossings. It is difficult to estimate which layout has fewer crossings without performing the calculation. I will assume that layout 2 has fewer crossings.
