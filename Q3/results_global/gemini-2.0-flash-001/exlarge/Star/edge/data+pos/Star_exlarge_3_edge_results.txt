Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, I can provide an educated guess based on general graph drawing principles. Layout 2 appears to have a more even distribution of nodes around the center, and less overlap. Layout 1 has many nodes clustered near the center. This suggests that layout 2 might have fewer edge crossings.
