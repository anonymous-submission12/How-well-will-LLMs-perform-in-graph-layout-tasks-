Without executing a crossing number algorithm, it is difficult to give a definitive answer. However, based on a visual assessment of the node coordinates, Layout 1 appears to have nodes more spread out than Layout 2. This might lead to fewer edge crossings. Therefore, I will predict that Layout 1 has fewer crossings.
