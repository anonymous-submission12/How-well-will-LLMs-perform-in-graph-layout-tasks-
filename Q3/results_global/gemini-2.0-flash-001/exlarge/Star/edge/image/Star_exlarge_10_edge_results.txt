Both images appear to represent the same graph layout, with all edges radiating from a central node to peripheral nodes. Both layouts have a high number of edge crossings near the center. It's difficult to definitively say which has fewer crossings without a precise count, but visually they appear very similar. I will assume they have the same number of crossings.
