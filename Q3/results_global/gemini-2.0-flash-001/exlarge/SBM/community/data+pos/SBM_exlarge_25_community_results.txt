Based on the graph data and node coordinates provided, it's difficult to definitively say which layout (1 or 2) keeps the community structure visually clearer *without actually visualizing the layouts*. However, I can make some educated guesses based on the coordinates:

Layout 1 seems to have a more spread-out arrangement of nodes, potentially allowing for better visual separation of communities.

Layout 2 has nodes with similar y coordinates, which might compress the visualization vertically and make it harder to distinguish communities.

Therefore, based on this limited analysis, I'd *guess* that Layout 1 is better.
