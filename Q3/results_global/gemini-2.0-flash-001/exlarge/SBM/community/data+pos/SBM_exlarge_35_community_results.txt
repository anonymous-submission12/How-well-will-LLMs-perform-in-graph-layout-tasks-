Based on the node coordinates provided, it's difficult to definitively say which layout (1 or 2) visually represents the community structure more clearly without seeing the actual plotted graphs. However, I can analyze the coordinates to make an informed guess.

In general, a layout that better reflects community structure will have nodes within the same community clustered together, with larger distances between clusters of different communities.

Looking at the coordinates, here's a qualitative assessment:

*   **Layout 1:** The coordinates seem more spread out across the x-y plane.

*   **Layout 2:** The coordinates also seem spread out, but there might be some tighter clusters.

Without visualization, it's hard to be certain.  However, I'll make a *guess* that Layout 2 might be slightly better at showing community structure, simply because the coordinates *seem* to suggest slightly tighter clusters.
