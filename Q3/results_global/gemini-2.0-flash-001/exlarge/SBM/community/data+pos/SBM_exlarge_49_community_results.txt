Based on the graph data and node coordinates provided, it's difficult to definitively say which layout (1 or 2) keeps the community structure visually clearer *without actually visualizing the layouts*. However, I can offer some reasoning based on the data:

Layout 1: The coordinates seem more spread out across the x and y axes.

Layout 2: The coordinates appear to be more clustered, with smaller ranges for both x and y.

Generally, a more spread-out layout (like Layout 1 *seems* to be) can sometimes make it easier to visually distinguish communities, as nodes within a community might be closer together, and different communities might be further apart. However, this is not always the case, and it depends heavily on how the graph is actually drawn.

Without visualization, it's impossible to be certain. Therefore, I will make a guess based on the coordinate distribution.
