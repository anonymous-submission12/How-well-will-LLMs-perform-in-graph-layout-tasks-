Based on the graph data and node coordinates provided, it's difficult to definitively say which layout (1 or 2) keeps the community structure visually clearer *without actually visualizing the layouts*. However, I can offer some observations that might help in making that determination *if* you were to plot the coordinates:

General Considerations for Community Structure Visualization:

*   **Spatial Separation:** A good layout for community structure will generally place nodes within the same community closer together and nodes from different communities further apart.
*   **Density:** Nodes within a community tend to be more densely connected. A layout that reflects this density can be helpful.
*   **Overlaps:** Minimizing node overlaps is important for visual clarity.

Without visualization, I can't give a definitive answer. I'll make a guess, but it's just that - a guess.
