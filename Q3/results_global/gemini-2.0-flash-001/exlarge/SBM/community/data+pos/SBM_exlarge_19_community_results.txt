Based on visual inspection, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better without seeing the actual plots. However, I can provide some reasoning based on the data provided.

The graph data is the same for both layouts. The difference lies in the node coordinates. To assess which layout is better for visualizing community structure, we would ideally look for layouts where nodes within the same community are clustered together, and nodes from different communities are further apart.

Without plotting, it's hard to tell. However, I will make a guess based on the coordinates. Layout 1 has coordinates that are more spread out, which might make it easier to distinguish communities.
