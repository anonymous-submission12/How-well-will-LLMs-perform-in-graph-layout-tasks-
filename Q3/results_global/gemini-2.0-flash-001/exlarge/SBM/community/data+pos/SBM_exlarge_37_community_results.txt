Based on the graph data and node coordinates provided, it's impossible to definitively say which layout (Answer 1 or Answer 2) keeps the community structure visually clearer *without actually visualizing the layouts*.  The coordinates alone don't provide enough information to judge the visual separation and density of potential communities.

However, I can make some educated guesses based on the *ranges* of the coordinates:

*   **Layout 1:** X-coordinates range from approximately -0.73 to 0.67. Y-coordinates range from approximately -0.99 to 1.0.
*   **Layout 2:** X-coordinates range from approximately -1.0 to 0.59. Y-coordinates range from approximately -0.69 to 0.61.

Without visualization, it's difficult to assess which layout better represents the community structure.
