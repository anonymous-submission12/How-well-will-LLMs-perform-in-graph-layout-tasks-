Based on the node coordinates, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better without visualizing them. However, I can make some observations that might help determine which *could* be better.

Layout 1: The coordinates seem more spread out across the -1 to 1 range in both x and y.

Layout 2: The coordinates are more clustered, with many nodes having similar x and y values.

A more spread-out layout (like layout 1 *appears* to be) is *generally* better for visualizing community structure because it allows more space between nodes and communities, making them easier to distinguish. However, this is not always the case.

Therefore, based on the coordinate distribution, I'll make a guess.
