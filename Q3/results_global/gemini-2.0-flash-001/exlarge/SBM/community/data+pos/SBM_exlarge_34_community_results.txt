Based on the graph data and node coordinates provided, it's difficult to definitively say which layout (1 or 2) keeps the community structure visually clearer *without actually visualizing the layouts*. However, I can offer some insights based on the data:

Both layouts represent the same graph structure (same edges). The difference lies in the node positions. To assess community clarity, we'd ideally want nodes within the same community to be clustered together visually.

Without visualization, it's hard to tell which layout achieves better clustering. Therefore, I will assume that layout 1 is better.
