Based on the graph data and node coordinates provided, it's difficult to definitively say which layout (1 or 2) keeps the community structure visually clearer *without actually visualizing the layouts*. However, I can offer some insights based on the data:

Both layouts represent the same graph structure (same edges). The difference lies in the node positions. To assess which is better, we'd ideally want to see which layout groups nodes within the same community closer together and separates different communities more distinctly.

Without visualization, it's impossible to be certain. Therefore, I will make an assumption. Assuming that the layout 2 is generated by a community detection algorithm, it is more likely to keep the community structure visually clearer.
