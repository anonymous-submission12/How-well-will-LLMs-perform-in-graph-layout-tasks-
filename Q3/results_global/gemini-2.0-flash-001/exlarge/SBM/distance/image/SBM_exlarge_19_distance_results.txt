Based on visual inspection, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. The nodes are clustered in a way that suggests shorter paths within clusters and longer paths between clusters. Layout 1 seems more uniformly distributed, making it harder to infer graph distances from the spatial arrangement.
