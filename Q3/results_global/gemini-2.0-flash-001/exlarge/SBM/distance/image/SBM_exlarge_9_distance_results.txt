Layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, the nodes are more densely packed and interconnected, making it difficult to visually estimate the shortest path between nodes. Layout 2, on the other hand, separates the graph into distinct clusters, which makes it easier to visually assess the distance between nodes within and between clusters.
