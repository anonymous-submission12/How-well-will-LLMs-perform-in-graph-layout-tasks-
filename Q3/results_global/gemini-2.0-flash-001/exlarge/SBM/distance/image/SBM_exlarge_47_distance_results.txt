Based on the visual representation of the two graph layouts, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 2, nodes that are close in the graph structure are also placed closer together in the layout, and nodes that are far apart in the graph structure are placed farther apart in the layout. This is evident in the distinct clusters that are formed, which are connected by relatively few edges. In contrast, layout 1 has more overlapping edges and less clear separation between clusters, making it harder to visually assess the graph-theoretic distance between nodes.
