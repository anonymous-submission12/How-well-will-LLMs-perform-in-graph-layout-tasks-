Based on the visual representation of the two graph layouts, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, the nodes are more densely packed and interconnected, making it difficult to discern the actual distances between nodes in the graph. Layout 2, on the other hand, separates the graph into two clusters connected by a few edges, which provides a clearer representation of the distances between nodes within each cluster and between the clusters.
