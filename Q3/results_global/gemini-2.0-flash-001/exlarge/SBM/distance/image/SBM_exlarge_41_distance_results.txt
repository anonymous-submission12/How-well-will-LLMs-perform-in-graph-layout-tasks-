Based on the visual representation of the two graph layouts, it's difficult to definitively say which one better preserves graph-theoretic distance without more rigorous analysis. However, I can make an educated guess based on the general principles of graph layout.

Layout 1 appears to maintain more consistent edge lengths within each cluster and between clusters. The nodes within each cluster are more tightly packed, and the separation between clusters is more pronounced. This suggests that the Euclidean distance between nodes in Layout 1 might be a better approximation of the graph-theoretic distance.

Layout 2 seems to stretch the graph in a way that distorts the relative distances between nodes. The clusters are less distinct, and the edge lengths vary more significantly.

Therefore, based on visual inspection, Layout 1 likely preserves graph-theoretic distance better.
