Based on the visual representation of the two graph layouts, it's difficult to definitively say which one better preserves graph-theoretic distance without more rigorous analysis. However, I can make an educated guess based on the clustering and edge lengths.

Layout 1 seems to group nodes into two distinct clusters, with relatively short edges within each cluster and longer edges connecting the clusters. Layout 2 seems to arrange the nodes in a more hierarchical fashion, with three clusters stacked vertically.

In general, layouts that minimize edge crossings and maintain relatively uniform edge lengths tend to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In this case, Layout 1 seems to have fewer edge crossings and more consistent edge lengths within each cluster.

Therefore, my best guess is that Layout 1 better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
