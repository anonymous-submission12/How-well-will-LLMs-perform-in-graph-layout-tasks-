Based on the visual representation of the two graph layouts, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 2, nodes that are close in the graph structure are also placed closer together in the layout, and nodes that are far apart in the graph structure are placed farther apart in the layout. This is more evident in the distinct clustering of nodes in layout 2, which reflects the underlying graph structure.
