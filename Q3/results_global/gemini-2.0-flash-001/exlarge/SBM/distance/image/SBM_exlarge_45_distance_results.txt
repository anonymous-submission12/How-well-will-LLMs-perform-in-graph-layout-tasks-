Based on the visual representation of the two graph layouts, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 2, nodes that are close in the graph structure are also placed closer together in the layout, forming distinct clusters. This makes it easier to visually estimate the distance between nodes based on their spatial proximity. In contrast, layout 1 seems more tangled, making it harder to infer graph distance from the layout.
