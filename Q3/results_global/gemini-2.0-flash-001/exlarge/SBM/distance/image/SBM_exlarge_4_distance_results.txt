Based on the visual representation of the two graph layouts, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, many nodes are clustered together, making it difficult to discern the actual distances between them in the graph. Layout 2 spreads the nodes out more evenly, making it easier to visually estimate the graph distances between nodes.
