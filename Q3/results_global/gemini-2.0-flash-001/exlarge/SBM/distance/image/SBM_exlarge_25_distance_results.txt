Based on the visual representation of the two graph layouts, it's difficult to definitively say which one better preserves graph-theoretic distance without knowing the true underlying graph structure and distances. However, we can make some educated guesses.

Layout 2 appears to group nodes into more distinct clusters. This suggests that nodes within a cluster are likely closer to each other in terms of graph distance than nodes in different clusters. This clustering effect can help to preserve the relative distances between nodes.

Layout 1, on the other hand, appears more uniformly distributed, with nodes more evenly spread out. This might lead to a less clear representation of the actual graph distances, as nodes that are far apart in the graph might be placed closer together in the layout, and vice versa.

Therefore, based on the visual cues, Layout 2 seems more likely to preserve graph-theoretic distance better than Layout 1.
