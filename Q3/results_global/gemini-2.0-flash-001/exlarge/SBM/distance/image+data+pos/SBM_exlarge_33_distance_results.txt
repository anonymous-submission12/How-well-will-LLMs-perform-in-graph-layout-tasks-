Based on visual inspection, Layout 1 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. The nodes that are close in the graph data are also placed closer together in Layout 1, and the overall structure of the graph seems more apparent. Layout 2 seems to compress some parts of the graph and stretch others, potentially distorting the distances between nodes.
