Based on visual inspection, layout 1 appears to better preserve the graph-theoretic distance. The nodes that are close in the graph data are also placed closer in layout 1 compared to layout 2. Layout 2 seems to cluster nodes into distinct groups, which might distort the actual distances between nodes that are not directly connected but have short paths.
