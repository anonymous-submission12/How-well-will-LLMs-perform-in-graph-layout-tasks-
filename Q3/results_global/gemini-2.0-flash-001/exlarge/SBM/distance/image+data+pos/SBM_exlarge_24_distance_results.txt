Based on the visual layouts, layout 1 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. The clusters in the graph seem more spatially separated in layout 1, which is consistent with the connectivity data. Layout 2 seems to compress some clusters more than others, potentially distorting the graph distances.
