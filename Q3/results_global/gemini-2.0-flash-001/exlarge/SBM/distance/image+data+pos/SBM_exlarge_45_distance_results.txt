Based on the visual representation of the graph layouts, Layout 1 appears to better preserve the graph-theoretic distance. In Layout 1, nodes that are close in the graph structure are also placed closer together in the layout. Layout 2 seems to cluster nodes into distinct groups, which might not accurately reflect the actual distances between nodes in the original graph.
