Based on visual inspection, layout 1 appears to better preserve the graph-theoretic distance. The clusters in layout 1 are more distinct and the distances between nodes within the clusters seem more consistent with the graph connectivity. Layout 2 seems to compress some clusters and stretch others, potentially distorting the graph-theoretic distances.
