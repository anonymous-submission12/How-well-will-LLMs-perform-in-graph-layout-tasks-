Based on the visual layouts and the provided graph data, it's difficult to definitively say which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance without quantitative analysis (e.g., calculating stress or other measures). However, we can make some qualitative observations.

Layout 1 appears to distribute the nodes more evenly across the space, potentially allowing for better preservation of distances for nodes that are far apart in the graph. Layout 2 seems to cluster nodes more tightly, which might be good for preserving distances between neighbors but could distort distances between nodes in different clusters.

Given these observations, it's plausible that Layout 1 provides a better overall preservation of graph-theoretic distance.
