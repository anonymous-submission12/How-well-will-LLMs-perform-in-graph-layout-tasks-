Based on visual inspection, layout 1 appears to better preserve the graph-theoretic distance. The nodes in layout 1 are more evenly distributed, and the clusters are more clearly defined. In layout 2, the nodes are more clustered together, which can make it difficult to distinguish between nodes that are close in the graph and nodes that are far apart.
