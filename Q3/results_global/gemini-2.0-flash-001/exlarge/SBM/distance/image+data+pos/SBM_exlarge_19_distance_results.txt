Based on visual inspection, layout 1 appears to better preserve the graph-theoretic distance. The nodes that are close in the graph data are also placed closer in layout 1 compared to layout 2. Layout 2 seems to cluster nodes more tightly, potentially distorting the actual distances between nodes in the graph.
