To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph distances. Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, I will use a heuristic approach.

I will consider a few node pairs and visually inspect the layouts to see if the Euclidean distances seem to reflect the graph distances.

Consider nodes 0 and 1. They are directly connected. In layout 1, the Euclidean distance between 0 and 1 seems reasonable. In layout 2, the Euclidean distance also seems reasonable.

Consider nodes 0 and 6. The shortest path is 0-1-6 or 0-3-6. In layout 1, the Euclidean distance between 0 and 6 seems a bit stretched. In layout 2, the Euclidean distance seems more compressed.

Consider nodes 15 and 16. There is no direct edge. The shortest path is 15-18-22-16. In layout 1, the Euclidean distance between 15 and 16 seems stretched. In layout 2, the Euclidean distance seems stretched as well.

Consider nodes 32 and 33. There is no direct edge. The shortest path is 32-39-33 or 32-40-33. In layout 1, the Euclidean distance between 32 and 33 seems reasonable. In layout 2, the Euclidean distance seems reasonable as well.

Based on visual inspection and considering a few node pairs, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, layout 2 seems to have a slightly better preservation of graph distances overall.
