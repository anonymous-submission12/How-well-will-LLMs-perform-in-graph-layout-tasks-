To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances between those nodes in the original graph. A good layout will have a strong correlation between these two distance measures. Since calculating all shortest paths and Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, we can consider a few representative node pairs and qualitatively assess which layout seems to better reflect the graph structure.

Consider nodes 0 and 1. They are directly connected in the graph.
In layout 1, their coordinates are (0.15, 0.01) and (0.32, 0.19).
In layout 2, their coordinates are (-0.1, -0.78) and (-0.14, -0.75).

Consider nodes 0 and 4. The shortest path between them is 0-2-4, so the distance is 2.
In layout 1, the coordinates are (0.15, 0.01) and (0.17, -1.0).
In layout 2, the coordinates are (-0.1, -0.78) and (-0.05, -1.0).

Consider nodes 13 and 25. The shortest path between them is 13-24-25 or 13-14-25, so the distance is 2.
In layout 1, the coordinates are (0.3, -0.34) and (0.08, -0.22).
In layout 2, the coordinates are (0.06, 0.35) and (0.06, 0.47).

Consider nodes 64 and 75. The shortest path between them is 64-68-65-75 or 64-69-65-75 or 64-71-70-75, so the distance is 3.
In layout 1, the coordinates are (-0.1, 0.04) and (0.14, -0.28).
In layout 2, the coordinates are (-0.22, -0.02) and (-0.4, -0.01).

Without performing detailed calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, by visual inspection and considering the relative positions of connected nodes, layout 1 seems to spread the nodes out more effectively, potentially leading to a better preservation of graph-theoretic distances. Layout 2 appears more clustered.
