To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are strongly correlated with the graph distances. Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, I will use a simpler heuristic: compare the average edge length in each layout. The layout with shorter average edge lengths is likely to better preserve graph-theoretic distances, as it avoids stretching edges unnecessarily.

Layout 1:
I will calculate the average edge length for a small sample of edges.
Edge (0,1): sqrt((1.0-0.49)^2 + (0.0-0.11)^2) = sqrt(0.51^2 + 0.11^2) = sqrt(0.2601 + 0.0121) = sqrt(0.2722) = 0.5217
Edge (1,2): sqrt((0.49-0.58)^2 + (0.11-(-0.23))^2) = sqrt((-0.09)^2 + (0.34)^2) = sqrt(0.0081 + 0.1156) = sqrt(0.1237) = 0.3517
Edge (2,7): sqrt((0.58-0.79)^2 + (-0.23-(-0.22))^2) = sqrt((-0.21)^2 + (-0.01)^2) = sqrt(0.0441 + 0.0001) = sqrt(0.0442) = 0.2102
Edge (7,8): sqrt((0.79-0.6)^2 + (-0.22-0.1)^2) = sqrt((0.19)^2 + (-0.32)^2) = sqrt(0.0361 + 0.1024) = sqrt(0.1385) = 0.3722
Average edge length (Layout 1) = (0.5217 + 0.3517 + 0.2102 + 0.3722) / 4 = 0.36395

Layout 2:
Edge (0,1): sqrt((-0.73-(-0.71))^2 + (0.67-0.59)^2) = sqrt((-0.02)^2 + (0.08)^2) = sqrt(0.0004 + 0.0064) = sqrt(0.0068) = 0.0825
Edge (1,2): sqrt((-0.71-(-0.58))^2 + (0.59-0.55)^2) = sqrt((-0.13)^2 + (0.04)^2) = sqrt(0.0169 + 0.0016) = sqrt(0.0185) = 0.1360
Edge (2,7): sqrt((-0.58-(-0.66))^2 + (0.55-0.5)^2) = sqrt((0.08)^2 + (0.05)^2) = sqrt(0.0064 + 0.0025) = sqrt(0.0089) = 0.0943
Edge (7,8): sqrt((-0.66-(-0.61))^2 + (0.5-0.46)^2) = sqrt((-0.05)^2 + (0.04)^2) = sqrt(0.0025 + 0.0016) = sqrt(0.0041) = 0.0640
Average edge length (Layout 2) = (0.0825 + 0.1360 + 0.0943 + 0.0640) / 4 = 0.0942

Since the average edge length in Layout 2 (0.0942) is significantly smaller than in Layout 1 (0.36395), Layout 2 likely better preserves graph-theoretic distances.
