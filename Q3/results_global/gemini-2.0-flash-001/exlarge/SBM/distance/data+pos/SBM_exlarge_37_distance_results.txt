Unfortunately, without performing computationally intensive calculations, it is difficult to definitively determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance. Graph-theoretic distance refers to the shortest path between two nodes in the graph. Preserving this distance in a layout means that nodes that are close in the graph should also be close in the layout.

To accurately assess this, one would need to:

1.  Calculate the graph-theoretic distance between all pairs of nodes in the original graph.
2.  For each layout, calculate the Euclidean distance between all pairs of nodes.
3.  Compare the two distance matrices (graph-theoretic vs. Euclidean) for each layout. A good layout would have a high correlation between the two.

Since I cannot perform these calculations, I will make a qualitative assessment based on the general characteristics of graph layout algorithms. Layout 2 appears to have a more even distribution of nodes, which might suggest a better preservation of graph-theoretic distances compared to Layout 1, where nodes seem more clustered. However, this is just a guess.
