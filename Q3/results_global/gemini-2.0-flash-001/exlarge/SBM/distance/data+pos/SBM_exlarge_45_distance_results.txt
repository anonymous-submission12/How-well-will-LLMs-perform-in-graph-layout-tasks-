To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we would ideally compare the graph-theoretic distances between all pairs of nodes to the Euclidean distances in each layout. The layout with a smaller difference between these distances, on average, would be considered better. However, this is computationally intensive.

Instead, we can look at some qualitative aspects of the layouts. Layout 1 appears to have a more spread-out distribution of nodes, while layout 2 seems to cluster nodes more tightly. Without performing the calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which is better. However, a more spread-out layout *might* better reflect the graph distances, as clustering could compress nodes that are far apart in the graph.

Given the limited information and without performing the detailed calculations, it's difficult to give a definitive answer. I will make an educated guess.
