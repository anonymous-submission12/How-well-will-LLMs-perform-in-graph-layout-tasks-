Unfortunately, I am unable to automatically evaluate which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance. To do this properly would require implementing a graph distance algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's or Floyd-Warshall) and comparing the pairwise distances in the graph to the Euclidean distances in each layout, then quantifying the difference.
