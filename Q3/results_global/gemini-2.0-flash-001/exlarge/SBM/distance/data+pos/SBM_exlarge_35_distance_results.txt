To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances between those nodes in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph distances.  Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, I will make a qualitative assessment based on visual inspection and typical graph layout principles.

Layout 1 appears to be a more standard graph layout, with nodes that are directly connected being placed closer together. Layout 2 seems to have some nodes clustered together in a way that doesn't necessarily reflect their connectivity in the graph. For example, nodes 38-55 are clustered together, but not all of them are directly connected.

Therefore, Layout 1 is more likely to preserve graph-theoretic distance.
