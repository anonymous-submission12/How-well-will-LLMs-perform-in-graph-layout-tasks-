Unfortunately, without performing extensive calculations, it's impossible to definitively say which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance. Graph-theoretic distance is the shortest path between two nodes in the graph. Preserving this distance in a layout means that nodes that are close in the graph (few edges between them) should also be close in the layout (Euclidean distance), and vice versa.

To determine which layout is better, you would need to:

1.  **Calculate graph-theoretic distances:** Compute the shortest path distance between all pairs of nodes in the original graph.
2.  **Calculate Euclidean distances:** For each layout, compute the Euclidean distance between all pairs of nodes based on their coordinates.
3.  **Compare the distances:** Compare the graph-theoretic distances with the Euclidean distances for each layout. A good layout will have a strong correlation between these two sets of distances. You could use metrics like the Spearman rank correlation coefficient to quantify this.

Since I cannot perform these calculations, I will have to make an informed guess. Layout 1 appears to have a more even distribution of nodes, while layout 2 seems to cluster some nodes together more tightly. Without further analysis, it's difficult to say which better reflects the true graph distances.
