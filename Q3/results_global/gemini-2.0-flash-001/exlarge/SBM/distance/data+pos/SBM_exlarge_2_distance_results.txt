To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph distances. Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, I will use a heuristic approach. I will look at a few example node pairs and visually assess which layout seems to better reflect the graph distances.

Let's consider nodes 0 and 6. In the graph, they are connected through nodes 7 and 8. So the graph distance is 3.
Layout 1: Node 0 is at [0.15, -0.01] and Node 6 is at [0.92, -0.23]. Euclidean distance is approximately 0.79.
Layout 2: Node 0 is at [-0.07, 0.22] and Node 6 is at [-0.2, 0.32]. Euclidean distance is approximately 0.16.

Let's consider nodes 43 and 70. The shortest path is 43-50-70, so the graph distance is 2.
Layout 1: Node 43 is at [-0.1, 0.51] and Node 70 is at [-0.17, -0.05]. Euclidean distance is approximately 0.56.
Layout 2: Node 43 is at [-0.31, 0.14] and Node 70 is at [-0.59, 0.52]. Euclidean distance is approximately 0.47.

Let's consider nodes 11 and 21.
Layout 1: Node 11 is at [0.1, -0.76] and Node 21 is at [-0.72, 0.24]. Euclidean distance is approximately 1.23.
Layout 2: Node 11 is at [0.45, -0.73] and Node 21 is at [0.19, -0.33]. Euclidean distance is approximately 0.48.

Without performing a full shortest path analysis and correlation, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, based on the examples, Layout 1 seems to spread the nodes out more, which might better reflect the graph distances.
