To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph distances.  Since a full quantitative comparison is complex and time-consuming, I will make a qualitative assessment based on the general structure and distribution of nodes in each layout.

Layout 1 seems to spread the nodes more evenly, potentially reflecting graph distances better. Layout 2 appears more clustered, which might distort the representation of graph distances.

Therefore, based on this qualitative assessment, Layout 1 is likely to preserve graph-theoretic distance better than Layout 2.
