To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph distances. Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, I will use a simplified approach. I will select a few node pairs and compare the ratio of their graph distance to their Euclidean distance in each layout. The layout with more consistent ratios across different node pairs is likely to be better at preserving graph-theoretic distance.

Let's choose node pairs (0, 15), (16, 30), and (32, 55).

- **Node pair (0, 15):**
  - Graph distance: 2 (0-1-15)
  - Layout 1 Euclidean distance: sqrt((-0.13 - -0.42)^2 + (-0.27 - -0.36)^2) = sqrt(0.29^2 + 0.09^2) = 0.304
  - Layout 2 Euclidean distance: sqrt((0.18 - 0.21)^2 + (0.59 - 0.6)^2) = sqrt((-0.03)^2 + (-0.01)^2) = 0.032
  - Ratio (Graph distance / Euclidean distance): Layout 1: 2/0.304 = 6.58; Layout 2: 2/0.032 = 62.5

- **Node pair (16, 30):**
  - Graph distance: 1
  - Layout 1 Euclidean distance: sqrt((0.23 - 0.32)^2 + (0.1 - 0.24)^2) = sqrt((-0.09)^2 + (-0.14)^2) = 0.166
  - Layout 2 Euclidean distance: sqrt((-0.45 - -0.39)^2 + (0.34 - 0.33)^2) = sqrt((-0.06)^2 + (0.01)^2) = 0.061
  - Ratio (Graph distance / Euclidean distance): Layout 1: 1/0.166 = 6.02; Layout 2: 1/0.061 = 16.39

- **Node pair (32, 55):**
  - Graph distance: 7 (32-37-43-6-7-11-15-55)
  - Layout 1 Euclidean distance: sqrt((0.33 - 0.03)^2 + (0.32 - 0.58)^2) = sqrt(0.3^2 + (-0.26)^2) = 0.398
  - Layout 2 Euclidean distance: sqrt((0.14 - -0.5)^2 + (-0.1 - -0.09)^2) = sqrt(0.64^2 + (-0.01)^2) = 0.64
  - Ratio (Graph distance / Euclidean distance): Layout 1: 7/0.398 = 17.59; Layout 2: 7/0.64 = 10.94

The ratios for Layout 1 are 6.58, 6.02, and 17.59. The ratios for Layout 2 are 62.5, 16.39, and 10.94. Layout 1 has more consistent ratios.
