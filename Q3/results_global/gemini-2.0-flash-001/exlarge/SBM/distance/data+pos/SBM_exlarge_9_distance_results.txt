To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are strongly correlated with the graph distances. Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally expensive, I will estimate by visually inspecting the layouts and considering a few key properties.

Layout 1 appears to have more nodes clustered together, potentially distorting graph distances. Layout 2 seems to spread the nodes out more evenly, which might better reflect the underlying graph structure. Without performing the full calculation, it's difficult to be certain, but based on the visual assessment, Layout 2 is more likely to preserve graph-theoretic distances better.
