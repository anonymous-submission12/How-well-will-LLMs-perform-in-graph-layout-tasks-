To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances between those nodes in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph distances. Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, I will use a simpler heuristic. I will look at a few example node pairs and visually assess which layout seems to better reflect the graph distances.

Let's consider nodes 0 and 68. They are directly connected in the graph.
In layout 1, the coordinates are (0.38, 0.04) and (-0.01, -0.01), respectively.
In layout 2, the coordinates are (0.54, -0.38) and (0.58, -0.02), respectively.

Let's consider nodes 0 and 5. The shortest path between them is 2.
In layout 1, the coordinates are (0.38, 0.04) and (0.39, 0.6), respectively.
In layout 2, the coordinates are (0.54, -0.38) and (0.68, -0.84), respectively.

Let's consider nodes 12 and 21. They are directly connected in the graph.
In layout 1, the coordinates are (-0.5, -0.15) and (-0.81, 0.02), respectively.
In layout 2, the coordinates are (-0.63, -0.69) and (-0.58, -0.78), respectively.

Without performing extensive calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, based on a visual inspection and considering a few node pairs, layout 1 seems to spread the nodes out more evenly, potentially preserving graph distances slightly better than layout 2, which appears more clustered in certain areas.
