To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have Euclidean distances that more closely correlate with the graph distances. Since calculating all pairwise graph distances and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive and not feasible in this setting, I will make a qualitative assessment based on the general structure and distribution of nodes in the two layouts.

Layout 1 appears to have a more even distribution of nodes, with some clustering but generally maintaining distances between connected nodes. Layout 2 seems to compress certain regions of the graph, potentially distorting the graph distances. Without performing the actual calculations, it's difficult to be certain, but based on visual inspection, Layout 1 seems more likely to preserve graph-theoretic distances better.
