To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph distances. Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, we can use a simpler heuristic: count the number of edge crossings. Layouts with fewer edge crossings tend to better preserve graph-theoretic distances. Unfortunately, I cannot automatically calculate the number of edge crossings. Therefore, I will make a qualitative assessment based on typical graph layout principles. Layouts that distribute nodes more evenly and avoid excessive clustering generally preserve graph distances better. Without visualization or a crossing count, this assessment is subjective.

Based on the coordinates provided, layout 1 appears to have a more even distribution of nodes compared to layout 2. Layout 2 seems to cluster nodes more tightly in certain regions, which might distort graph distances.
