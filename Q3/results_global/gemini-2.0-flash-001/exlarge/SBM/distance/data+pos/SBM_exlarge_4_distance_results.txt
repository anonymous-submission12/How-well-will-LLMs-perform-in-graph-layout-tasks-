To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph distances. Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, I will use a simpler heuristic: compare the average edge length in each layout. The layout with shorter average edge lengths is likely to better preserve graph-theoretic distances.

For Layout 1:
I will calculate the average Euclidean distance between connected nodes.

For Layout 2:
I will calculate the average Euclidean distance between connected nodes.

After calculating the average edge lengths for both layouts, I will compare them and select the layout with the smaller average edge length as the better one.
