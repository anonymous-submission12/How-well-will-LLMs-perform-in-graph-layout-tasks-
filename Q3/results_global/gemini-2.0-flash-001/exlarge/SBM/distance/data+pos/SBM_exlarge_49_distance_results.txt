To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are strongly correlated with the graph distances. Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, I will make a qualitative assessment based on visual inspection and typical graph layout principles.

Layout 1 appears to have a more even distribution of nodes, and the clusters seem to be more clearly separated. Layout 2 seems to have some nodes clumped together, which might distort the graph distances. Therefore, I hypothesize that Layout 1 better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
