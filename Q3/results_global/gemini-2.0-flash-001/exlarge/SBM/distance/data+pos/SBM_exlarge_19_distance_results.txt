To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph distances. Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, I will use a simpler heuristic. I will look for obvious distortions in each layout.

In layout 1, node 63 is at [-0.72, 0.09] and node 12 is at [-0.09, -0.4]. They are connected by an edge in the graph. Node 69 is at [-0.43, -0.24] and node 9 is at [-0.41, -0.64]. They are connected by an edge in the graph.

In layout 2, node 63 is at [0.47, 0.06] and node 12 is at [-0.18, -0.03]. They are connected by an edge in the graph. Node 69 is at [0.26, -0.12] and node 9 is at [-0.37, -0.23]. They are connected by an edge in the graph.

Without performing extensive calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, based on a visual inspection and the relative positions of connected nodes, layout 2 seems to have less obvious distortions compared to layout 1.
