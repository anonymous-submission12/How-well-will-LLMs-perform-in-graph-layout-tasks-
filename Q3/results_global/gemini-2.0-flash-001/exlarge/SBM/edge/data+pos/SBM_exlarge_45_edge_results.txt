Without executing a crossing counting algorithm, it's impossible to give a definitive answer. However, I can make an educated guess based on general graph layout principles. Layout 2 appears to have a more organized structure, with nodes that are connected being placed closer together. Layout 1 has node 51 far away from node 4, which are connected. Therefore, it is likely that layout 2 has fewer edge crossings.
