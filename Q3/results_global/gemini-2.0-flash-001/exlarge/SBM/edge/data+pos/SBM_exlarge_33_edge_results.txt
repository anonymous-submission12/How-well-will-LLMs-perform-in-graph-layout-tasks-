Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, I can provide a reasoned guess based on general graph layout principles.

Layout 2 appears to have a more even distribution of nodes and edges across the space (0 to 1 in both x and y). Layout 1 seems to cluster nodes more tightly in certain areas. Generally, more evenly distributed layouts tend to have fewer crossings. Therefore, I will guess that layout 2 has fewer crossings.
