Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it is difficult to give a definitive answer. However, I can make an educated guess based on general graph layout principles. Layout 2 appears to have a more organized structure, with nodes that are connected being closer together. Layout 1 has nodes all over the place, which likely leads to more edge crossings.
