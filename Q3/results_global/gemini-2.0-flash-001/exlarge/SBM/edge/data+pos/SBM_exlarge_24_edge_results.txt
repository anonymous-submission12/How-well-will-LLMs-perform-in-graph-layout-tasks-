Without executing a layout algorithm and counting edge crossings, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, I can provide a heuristic based on the node coordinates. Layout 2 appears to have nodes more evenly distributed, which *might* lead to fewer crossings. Layout 1 seems to have some nodes clustered together.

Therefore, I'll make an educated guess.
