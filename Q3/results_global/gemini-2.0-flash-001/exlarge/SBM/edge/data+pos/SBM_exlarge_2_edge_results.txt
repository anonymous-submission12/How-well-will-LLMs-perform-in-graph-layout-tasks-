Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer edge crossings. However, I can provide an educated guess based on general graph drawing principles.

Layout 1 appears to have a more even distribution of nodes, while layout 2 seems to have some nodes clustered together, especially in the negative y direction. Clustered nodes often lead to more edge crossings. Therefore, my guess is that layout 1 has fewer crossings.
