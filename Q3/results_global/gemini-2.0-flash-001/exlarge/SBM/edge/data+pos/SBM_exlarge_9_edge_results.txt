Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, based on a general understanding of graph layout principles, I can provide a reasoned guess. Layout 2 appears to have a more organized structure, with nodes seemingly distributed in a way that might minimize edge overlaps. Layout 1 seems more scattered.
