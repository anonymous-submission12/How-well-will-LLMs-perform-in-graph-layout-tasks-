Estimating the number of edge crossings without visualizing the graph is difficult. However, we can make some educated guesses based on the node coordinates. Layout 2 appears to have a more organized structure, with nodes that are connected being placed closer together. Layout 1 has some nodes that are far apart, which could lead to more edge crossings. Therefore, I will guess that layout 2 has fewer edge crossings.
