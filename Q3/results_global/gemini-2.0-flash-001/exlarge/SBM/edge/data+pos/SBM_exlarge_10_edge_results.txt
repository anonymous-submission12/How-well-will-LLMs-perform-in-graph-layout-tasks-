Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer edge crossings. However, I can make an educated guess based on general graph layout principles. Layout 2 appears to have a more structured and less overlapping arrangement of nodes, especially in the central region of the graph. Layout 1 has nodes scattered more randomly. Therefore, it's likely that layout 2 has fewer edge crossings.
