Without executing a graph layout algorithm and counting edge crossings, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, I can make an educated guess based on general principles of graph layout.

Layout 2 appears to have a more organized structure, with nodes seemingly distributed more evenly. Layout 1 has some nodes clustered together (e.g., around coordinates close to 0,0). Clustered nodes often lead to more edge crossings. Therefore, I'll predict that Layout 2 has fewer crossings.
