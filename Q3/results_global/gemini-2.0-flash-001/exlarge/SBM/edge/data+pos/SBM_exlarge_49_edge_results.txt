Without executing a graph layout algorithm and counting edge crossings, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, I can provide a reasoned guess based on general principles of graph layout.

Layout 2 appears to be a more structured layout. The coordinates seem to place related nodes closer together, which generally leads to fewer edge crossings. Layout 1 has some nodes that seem arbitrarily placed.

Therefore, my guess is that layout 2 has fewer edge crossings.
