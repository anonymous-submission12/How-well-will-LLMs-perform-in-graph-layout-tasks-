Without executing a graph layout algorithm and counting edge crossings, it is impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, I can make an educated guess based on the distribution of nodes. Layout 2 seems to have a more even distribution of nodes, especially in the area where nodes 25-49 are located. Layout 1 has some nodes clustered together, which might lead to more crossings. Therefore, I'll predict that layout 2 has fewer crossings.
