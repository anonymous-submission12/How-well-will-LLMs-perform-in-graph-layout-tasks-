Without executing a graph layout algorithm and counting edge crossings, it is impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, based on the node coordinates, I can make an educated guess. The coordinates for layout 2 seem to place nodes in a more organized fashion, potentially leading to fewer edge crossings.
