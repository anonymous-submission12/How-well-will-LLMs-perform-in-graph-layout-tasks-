Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer edge crossings. However, I can provide a reasoned guess based on general graph layout principles.

Layout 2 appears to have a more organized structure, with nodes seemingly distributed more evenly. Layout 1 has some nodes clustered together, which could lead to more edge crossings. Therefore, I'll guess that Layout 2 has fewer crossings.
