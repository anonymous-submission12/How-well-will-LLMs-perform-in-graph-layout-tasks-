Without executing a graph layout algorithm and counting crossings, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, I can make an educated guess based on general principles of graph layout. A good layout algorithm tries to minimize edge crossings.

Judging by the coordinates, Layout 1 seems more scattered and less organized. Layout 2 appears to have nodes clustered more tightly, which might lead to fewer long edges that could cross.

Therefore, I'll guess that Layout 2 has fewer crossings.
