Estimating the number of edge crossings accurately without visualizing the graph layouts is difficult. However, I can provide a reasoned guess based on general principles of graph layout.

Layout 1 appears to have nodes more spread out across the coordinate space, while layout 2 seems to have nodes clustered more closely together. Generally, more spread-out layouts tend to have fewer edge crossings. Therefore, I will guess that layout 1 has fewer crossings.
