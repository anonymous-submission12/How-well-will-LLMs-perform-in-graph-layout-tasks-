Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer edge crossings. However, I can provide a general heuristic. Layouts that distribute nodes more evenly and avoid dense clusters tend to have fewer crossings.

Based on a visual estimation *only*, and with no guarantee of accuracy, layout 1 *appears* to have a more even distribution of nodes than layout 2. Layout 2 seems to have more nodes clustered in certain areas, which could lead to more edge crossings.
