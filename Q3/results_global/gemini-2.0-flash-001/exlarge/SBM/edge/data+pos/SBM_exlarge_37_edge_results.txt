Without being able to visualize the layouts, it's impossible to definitively determine which has fewer edge crossings. However, I can provide a heuristic estimate. A more spread-out layout generally has fewer crossings.

Layout 1 has node coordinates that are more clustered together. Layout 2 seems to have a wider distribution of node coordinates.

Therefore, based on this heuristic, layout 2 is likely to have fewer edge crossings.
