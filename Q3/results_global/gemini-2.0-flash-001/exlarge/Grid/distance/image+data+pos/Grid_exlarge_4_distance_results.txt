The first layout appears to be a more disorganized placement of nodes, while the second layout arranges the nodes in a snake-like structure. Given the graph data, which represents a chain-like structure with some connections between nodes that are close in the chain, the second layout better reflects the graph-theoretic distance. Nodes that are far apart in the chain are also far apart in the layout, and nodes that are close are also close in the layout. The first layout does not preserve this property as well.
