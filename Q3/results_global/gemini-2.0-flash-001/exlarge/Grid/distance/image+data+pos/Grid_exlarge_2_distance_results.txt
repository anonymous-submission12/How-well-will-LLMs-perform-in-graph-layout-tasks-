The first layout appears to preserve graph-theoretic distance better than the second layout. The second layout distorts the graph by mapping it onto a curved shape, which significantly alters the Euclidean distances between nodes that are far apart in the graph. The first layout, while not perfect, maintains a more consistent relationship between graph distance and Euclidean distance.
