To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph distances. Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, I will make a qualitative assessment based on the node coordinates provided.

Layout 1 appears to have more variability in edge lengths. Some connected nodes are very close together, while others are farther apart. This suggests that the Euclidean distances may not accurately reflect the graph distances.

Layout 2 seems to have a more uniform distribution of nodes. The distances between connected nodes appear to be more consistent. This suggests that the Euclidean distances might be a better approximation of the graph distances compared to Layout 1.

Therefore, based on this qualitative assessment, Layout 2 likely preserves graph-theoretic distance better than Layout 1.
