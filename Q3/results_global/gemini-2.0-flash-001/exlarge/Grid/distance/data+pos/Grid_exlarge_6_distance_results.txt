To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A good layout will have a strong correlation between these two distance measures. Calculating this for the entire graph is computationally expensive. Instead, we can sample a few node pairs and compare the consistency of their distances in the two layouts.

Let's consider node pairs (0, 38), (10, 77), and (20, 60).

*   **Layout 1:**
    *   Distance(0, 38) in graph: Many paths exist. A possible path is 0-1-2-3...38, which has length 38.
    *   Euclidean distance(0, 38): sqrt((-0.04 - (-0.58))^2 + (-0.93 - (-0.15))^2) = sqrt(0.54^2 + (-0.78)^2) = sqrt(0.2916 + 0.6084) = sqrt(0.9) = 0.948
    *   Distance(10, 77) in graph: Many paths exist. A possible path is 10-11-12...38-77, or 10-49-50...77.
    *   Euclidean distance(10, 77): sqrt((0.68 - (-0.83))^2 + (-0.27 - (-0.38))^2) = sqrt(1.51^2 + 0.11^2) = sqrt(2.2801 + 0.0121) = sqrt(2.2922) = 1.514
    *   Distance(20, 60) in graph: Many paths exist.
    *   Euclidean distance(20, 60): sqrt((0.07 - 0.33)^2 + (0.67 - 0.32)^2) = sqrt((-0.26)^2 + (0.35)^2) = sqrt(0.0676 + 0.1225) = sqrt(0.1901) = 0.436

*   **Layout 2:**
    *   Distance(0, 38) in graph: Same as above, 38.
    *   Euclidean distance(0, 38): sqrt((-0.86 - (-0.13))^2 + (0.23 - 0.98)^2) = sqrt((-0.73)^2 + (-0.75)^2) = sqrt(0.5329 + 0.5625) = sqrt(1.0954) = 1.047
    *   Distance(10, 77) in graph: Same as above.
    *   Euclidean distance(10, 77): sqrt((0.0 - (-0.12))^2 + (-0.13 - 0.9)^2) = sqrt(0.12^2 + (-1.03)^2) = sqrt(0.0144 + 1.0609) = sqrt(1.0753) = 1.037
    *   Distance(20, 60) in graph: Same as above.
    *   Euclidean distance(20, 60): sqrt((0.26 - 0.37)^2 + (-0.73 - (-0.8))^2) = sqrt((-0.11)^2 + (0.07)^2) = sqrt(0.0121 + 0.0049) = sqrt(0.017) = 0.130

Without performing more rigorous calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, based on the sampled distances, Layout 2 seems to have a more consistent scaling of Euclidean distances relative to graph distances. The Euclidean distances in Layout 1 vary more widely for similar graph distances.
