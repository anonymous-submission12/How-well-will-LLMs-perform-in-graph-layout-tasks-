To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances between those nodes in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph distances. Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, we can consider the overall structure and make an informed estimation.

The graph structure is essentially a grid or ladder-like structure. Nodes 0-17 and 18-35 form two parallel chains, connected by edges (0,18), (1,19), ..., (17,35). Nodes 36-53 form another chain connected to 18-35, and nodes 54-71 form the last chain connected to 36-53.

Layout 2 appears to be a more uniform and linear representation of the graph. The nodes are arranged in a way that visually reflects the chain-like structure of the graph. Layout 1 seems to have more distortions and clusters, which might not accurately reflect the graph distances. For example, nodes that are far apart in the graph might be placed closer together in the layout, and vice versa.

Therefore, Layout 2 is likely to better preserve graph-theoretic distance.
