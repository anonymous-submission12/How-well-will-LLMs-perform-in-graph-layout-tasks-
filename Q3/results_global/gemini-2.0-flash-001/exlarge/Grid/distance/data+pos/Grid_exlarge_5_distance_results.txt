To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two distance measures. Since calculating all pairwise distances and their correlations is computationally intensive and not feasible in this setting, I will make a qualitative assessment based on the visual characteristics of the layouts.

Layout 1 appears to be more evenly distributed and less distorted compared to Layout 2. Layout 2 seems to compress nodes towards the center, which might distort the Euclidean distances and make them less representative of the graph distances. Therefore, Layout 1 is likely to preserve graph-theoretic distances better.
