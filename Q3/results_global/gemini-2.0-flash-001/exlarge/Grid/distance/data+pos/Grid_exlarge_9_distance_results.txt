To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. Since calculating all pairwise distances and comparing them would be computationally expensive, we can take a sample of node pairs and compare the distances.  However, given the nature of the graph (a chain with additional edges connecting nodes close in the chain), we can focus on comparing distances between nodes that are further apart in the graph.

Layout 1 seems to spread the nodes more evenly, while layout 2 appears more compressed. A more spread-out layout generally preserves graph distances better because the Euclidean distances are more likely to reflect the path lengths in the graph.

Therefore, based on visual inspection and the general principle that a more spread-out layout tends to preserve graph distances better, layout 1 is likely to be better.
