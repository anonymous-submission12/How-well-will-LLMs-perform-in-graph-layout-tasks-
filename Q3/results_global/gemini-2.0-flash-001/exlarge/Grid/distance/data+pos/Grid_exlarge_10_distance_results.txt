To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two distance measures. Since calculating all pairwise distances and their correlations is computationally intensive and not feasible in this setting, I will make a qualitative assessment based on the visual characteristics of the layouts.

Layout 1 appears to be more disorganized and less structured. The nodes are scattered, and it's difficult to visually identify paths that correspond to graph distances.

Layout 2, on the other hand, seems to arrange the nodes in a more structured manner. There's a clearer sense of how nodes are connected, and the Euclidean distances between connected nodes appear to be more consistent with the graph distances. The layout seems to follow a more or less grid-like structure.

Based on this qualitative assessment, Layout 2 is more likely to preserve graph-theoretic distances better than Layout 1.
