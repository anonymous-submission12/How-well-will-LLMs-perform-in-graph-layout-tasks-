To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances between those nodes in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph distances. Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, I will approximate by visually inspecting the layouts and considering a few key properties.

The graph is a ladder graph, which consists of two parallel paths connected by rungs. Ideally, a good layout would reflect this structure.

Layout 1 appears to be a more distorted representation of the ladder graph. The nodes are scattered, and the parallel paths and rungs are not clearly represented.

Layout 2 seems to preserve the ladder structure better. The two parallel paths are more clearly visible, and the rungs connecting them are also more apparent. This suggests that the Euclidean distances in Layout 2 are more likely to be correlated with the graph distances.

Therefore, Layout 2 likely better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
