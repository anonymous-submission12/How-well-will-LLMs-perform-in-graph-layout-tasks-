Layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, nodes that are far apart in the graph could be placed close together in the layout, and vice versa. Layout 2 has a more regular structure, where the Euclidean distance between nodes is more likely to reflect the graph-theoretic distance.
