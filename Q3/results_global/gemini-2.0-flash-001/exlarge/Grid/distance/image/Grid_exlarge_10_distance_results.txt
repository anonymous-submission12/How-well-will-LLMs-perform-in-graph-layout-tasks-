Based on the visual characteristics of the two graph layouts, the second layout (the grid-like structure) appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In the first layout, the nodes are arranged more randomly, making it difficult to infer the actual graph distance between nodes based on their spatial proximity in the layout. The second layout, with its grid-like structure, provides a more consistent relationship between spatial distance in the layout and graph distance.
