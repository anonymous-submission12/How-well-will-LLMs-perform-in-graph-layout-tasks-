Based on the visual representation, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, nodes that are far apart in the graph might be placed close together in the layout, and vice versa. Layout 2, with its more structured grid-like arrangement, seems to maintain a more consistent relationship between the graph distance and the Euclidean distance in the layout.
