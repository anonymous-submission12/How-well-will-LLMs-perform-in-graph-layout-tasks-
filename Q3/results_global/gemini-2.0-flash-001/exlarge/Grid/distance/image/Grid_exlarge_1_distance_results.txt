Based on the visual representation of the two graph layouts, the second layout (the one that looks like a ribbon or a snake) appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In the first layout, nodes that are far apart in the graph could be placed close together in the layout, and vice versa. The second layout seems to arrange the nodes in a way that reflects their connectivity and distance within the graph more accurately.
