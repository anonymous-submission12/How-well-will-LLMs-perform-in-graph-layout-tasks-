Based on the visual characteristics of the two layouts, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 2, nodes that are close in the graph structure are also placed close to each other in the layout. This is evident from the grid-like structure, where adjacent nodes are consistently placed next to each other. In contrast, layout 1 seems to have a more random arrangement, where nodes that are close in the graph may be placed far apart in the layout.
