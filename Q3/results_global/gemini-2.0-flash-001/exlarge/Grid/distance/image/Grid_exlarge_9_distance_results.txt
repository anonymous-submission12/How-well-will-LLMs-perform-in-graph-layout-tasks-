Based on the visual characteristics of the two layouts, the second layout (Layout 2) appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In Layout 1, the nodes are arranged in a more scattered and seemingly random manner, making it difficult to visually estimate the shortest path between any two nodes. In contrast, Layout 2 exhibits a more structured arrangement, with nodes forming clear chains and loops. This structure allows for a better visual approximation of the graph-theoretic distance between nodes, as the physical distance between nodes in the layout more closely reflects the number of edges in the shortest path between them.
