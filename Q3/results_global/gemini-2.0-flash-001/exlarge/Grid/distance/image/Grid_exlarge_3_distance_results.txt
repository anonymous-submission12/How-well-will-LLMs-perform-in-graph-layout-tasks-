Layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, the nodes are arranged seemingly randomly, making it difficult to visually estimate the shortest path between any two nodes. In layout 2, the grid-like structure makes it easier to estimate the number of hops between nodes, thus better preserving graph-theoretic distance.
