Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, based on a visual assessment of the node coordinates, layout 2 appears to be a more organized and structured layout, which *suggests* it might have fewer crossings. Layout 1 seems more scattered.
