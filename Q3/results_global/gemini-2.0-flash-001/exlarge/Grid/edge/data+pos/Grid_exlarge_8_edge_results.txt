Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer edge crossings. However, I can provide a reasoned guess based on general graph layout principles.

Layout 2 appears to be a more organized and evenly distributed layout compared to Layout 1. Layout 1 has some nodes clustered together, which might lead to more edge crossings. Layout 2 seems to follow a more radial or layered structure, which often results in fewer crossings.

Therefore, my educated guess is that Layout 2 has fewer edge crossings.
