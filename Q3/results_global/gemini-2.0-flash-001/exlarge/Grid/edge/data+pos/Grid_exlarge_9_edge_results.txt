Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, based on a visual assessment of the node coordinates, layout 2 appears to be a more organized and less tangled layout than layout 1. Therefore, I will predict that layout 2 has fewer edge crossings.
