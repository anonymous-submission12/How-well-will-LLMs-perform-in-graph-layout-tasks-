Without executing a crossings counting algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, based on a visual assessment of the node coordinates, layout 1 appears to be more randomly distributed, while layout 2 seems to arrange the nodes in a more circular or spiral fashion. Generally, layouts that follow a more structured or ordered arrangement tend to have fewer crossings than those with a more random arrangement, especially for chain-like graphs. Therefore, I will predict that layout 2 has fewer crossings.
