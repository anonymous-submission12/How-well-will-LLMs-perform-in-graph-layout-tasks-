Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, based on a visual assessment of the node coordinates, layout 2 appears to be a more linear and organized arrangement than layout 1. Layout 1 has nodes scattered more randomly. Therefore, layout 2 is likely to have fewer edge crossings.
