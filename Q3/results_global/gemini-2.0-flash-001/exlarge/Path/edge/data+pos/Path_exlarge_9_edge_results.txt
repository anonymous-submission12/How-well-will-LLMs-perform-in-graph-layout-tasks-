Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, based on a visual assessment of the node coordinates, layout 2 appears to be a more organized, linear arrangement, which generally leads to fewer crossings than the more scattered arrangement in layout 1. Therefore, I will predict that layout 2 has fewer crossings.
