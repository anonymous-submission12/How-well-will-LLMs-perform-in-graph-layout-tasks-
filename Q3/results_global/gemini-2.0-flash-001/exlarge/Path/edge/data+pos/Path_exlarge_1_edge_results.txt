Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, based on the node coordinates provided, layout 1 appears to have a more random distribution of nodes, while layout 2 seems to arrange the nodes in a more linear fashion. A linear arrangement often leads to fewer crossings, especially with edges that connect consecutive nodes. Therefore, I will predict that layout 2 has fewer crossings.
