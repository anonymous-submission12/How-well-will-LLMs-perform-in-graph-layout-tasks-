Without executing a complex crossing number algorithm, it's difficult to definitively determine the exact number of edge crossings for each layout. However, we can make an educated guess based on the node coordinates and edge connections.

Layout 1 appears to have nodes scattered somewhat randomly within a confined space. This arrangement is likely to result in a higher number of edge crossings as edges will need to traverse the space between nodes that are not linearly aligned.

Layout 2, on the other hand, seems to have nodes arranged in a more linear or sequential fashion. The coordinates suggest a chain-like structure, which typically results in fewer edge crossings.

Therefore, based on visual assessment and the general principles of graph layout, Layout 2 is likely to have fewer edge crossings.
