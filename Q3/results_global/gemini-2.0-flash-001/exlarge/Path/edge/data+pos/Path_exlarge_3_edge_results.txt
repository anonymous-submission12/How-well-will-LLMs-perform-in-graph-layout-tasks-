Without executing a complex crossing number algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine the exact number of edge crossings in each layout. However, based on the node coordinates provided, I can make a qualitative assessment.

Layout 2 appears to be a more organized layout, resembling a chain or a path. The coordinates seem to follow a more linear progression. Layout 1, on the other hand, has nodes scattered more randomly. This suggests that Layout 1 is likely to have more edge crossings than Layout 2.
