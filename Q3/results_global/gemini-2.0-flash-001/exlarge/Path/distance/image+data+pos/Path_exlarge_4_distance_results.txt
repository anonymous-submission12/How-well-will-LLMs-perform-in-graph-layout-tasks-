The graph data represents a path graph. In layout 1, the nodes are scattered randomly, making it difficult to visually discern the path structure and estimate graph-theoretic distances. In layout 2, the nodes are arranged in a sequential manner, closely following the path structure of the graph. This arrangement makes it much easier to estimate graph-theoretic distances by simply observing the physical distance between nodes along the path. Therefore, layout 2 better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
