The graph data represents a path graph. In a path graph, the graph-theoretic distance between two nodes is simply the number of edges in the shortest path connecting them, which is also the number of nodes between them.

Layout 1 appears to be a more random layout, while layout 2 appears to arrange the nodes in a more sequential manner, resembling the structure of a path graph. Therefore, layout 2 better preserves the graph-theoretic distance.
