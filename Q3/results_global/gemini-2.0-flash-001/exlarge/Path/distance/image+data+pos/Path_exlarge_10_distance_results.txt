The graph data represents a simple path. Layout 2 arranges the nodes in a way that visually reflects this path structure, with nodes placed sequentially along a winding line. Layout 1, on the other hand, scatters the nodes more randomly, making it difficult to discern the underlying path structure. Therefore, layout 2 better preserves the graph-theoretic distance.
