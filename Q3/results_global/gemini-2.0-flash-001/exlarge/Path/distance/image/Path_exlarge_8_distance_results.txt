Based on visual inspection, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. The nodes are arranged in a more structured manner, suggesting that the Euclidean distance between nodes is more likely to reflect the actual path length between them in the graph. Layout 1 seems more random, making it difficult to infer graph distances from the visual layout.
