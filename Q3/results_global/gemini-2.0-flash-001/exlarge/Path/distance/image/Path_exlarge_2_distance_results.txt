Based on the layouts provided, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 2, nodes that are close in the graph are also close in the layout, and the overall structure seems to follow a more natural embedding of the graph's connectivity. Layout 1 appears more tangled and less representative of the underlying graph structure.
