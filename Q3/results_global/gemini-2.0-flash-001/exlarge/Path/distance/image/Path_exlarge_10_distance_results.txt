Layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, the nodes are arranged in a more tangled and overlapping manner, making it difficult to visually estimate the shortest path between nodes. Layout 2, on the other hand, has a more spread-out and organized structure, which makes it easier to trace paths and estimate distances.
