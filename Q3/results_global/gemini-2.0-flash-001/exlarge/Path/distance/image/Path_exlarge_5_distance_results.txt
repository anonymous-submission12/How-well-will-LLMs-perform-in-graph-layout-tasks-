Based on the layouts provided, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, nodes that are far apart in the graph may appear close together in the layout, and vice versa. Layout 2 seems to arrange the nodes in a way that the Euclidean distance between nodes in the layout is more correlated with the graph-theoretic distance.
