Based on the visual characteristics of the two layouts, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, many nodes are clustered together, making it difficult to discern the actual path lengths between them. Layout 2, on the other hand, spreads the nodes out more evenly, providing a clearer representation of the connections and distances between nodes.
