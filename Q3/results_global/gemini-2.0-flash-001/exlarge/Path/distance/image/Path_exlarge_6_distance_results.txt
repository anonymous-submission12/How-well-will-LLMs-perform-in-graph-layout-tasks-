Based on the visual representation, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, the nodes are clustered together in a way that makes it difficult to discern the actual distances between nodes in the graph. Layout 2, on the other hand, spreads the nodes out more evenly, making it easier to estimate the graph-theoretic distance between nodes based on their spatial proximity in the layout.
