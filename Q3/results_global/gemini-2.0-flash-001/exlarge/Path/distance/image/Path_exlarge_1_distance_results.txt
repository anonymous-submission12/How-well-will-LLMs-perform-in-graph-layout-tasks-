Based on the layouts provided, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, the nodes are arranged in a more tangled and overlapping manner, making it difficult to visually estimate the shortest path between nodes. In contrast, layout 2 presents a more structured and elongated arrangement, where the relative distances between nodes along the graph's edges are more clearly represented.
