The graph data represents a simple chain graph. The ideal layout would be a straight line, preserving the graph distances perfectly. Let's consider how well each layout approximates this.

Layout 1 appears to be a somewhat scattered layout, with nodes not arranged in a straight line. Layout 2, on the other hand, seems to follow a more linear arrangement, although it's curved.

Since the graph is a simple path, the graph distance between nodes i and j is simply |i-j|. We want the Euclidean distance between the nodes in the layout to be close to this graph distance. Intuitively, layout 2 seems better because it's closer to a straight line.

Therefore, layout 2 better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
