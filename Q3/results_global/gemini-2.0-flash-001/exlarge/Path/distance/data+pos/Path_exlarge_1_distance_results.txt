The graph data represents a simple chain graph. The ideal layout would be a straight line, preserving graph distance perfectly. Let's consider how well each layout approximates this.

Layout 1 has nodes scattered somewhat randomly in 2D space. Layout 2 appears to follow a more linear path, although it curves.

Since layout 2 is closer to a straight line than layout 1, it better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
