The graph data represents a simple path. In an ideal layout that perfectly preserves graph-theoretic distance, the nodes would be placed along a straight line with equal spacing.

Layout 2 appears to be closer to a straight line than Layout 1. Therefore, Layout 2 likely better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
