The graph data represents a simple path. The ideal layout would be a straight line, preserving graph distance perfectly. Let's visually assess how close each layout is to a straight line.

Layout 1 appears to be a somewhat distorted layout, with nodes scattered around. Layout 2 appears to be a more linear layout, resembling a slightly curved line. Therefore, Layout 2 should better preserve graph-theoretic distance.
