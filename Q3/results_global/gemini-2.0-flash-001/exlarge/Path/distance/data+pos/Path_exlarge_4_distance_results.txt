The graph data represents a simple path. In an ideal layout that perfectly preserves graph-theoretic distance, the nodes would be placed in a straight line with equal spacing.

Layout 1 has nodes scattered somewhat randomly in 2D space. Layout 2 appears to place the nodes along a curve, but the spacing between consecutive nodes seems more uniform than in layout 1. Therefore, layout 2 is likely to better preserve graph-theoretic distance.
