Let's analyze how well each layout preserves graph-theoretic distances. The graph is a simple path from node 0 to node 75. Ideally, a good layout would place the nodes in a way that the Euclidean distance between nodes reflects their path distance in the graph.

Layout 1: The nodes seem somewhat scattered, with no clear linear progression.

Layout 2: The nodes are arranged in a more linear fashion, following the path structure of the graph.

Based on this visual assessment, Layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distances.
