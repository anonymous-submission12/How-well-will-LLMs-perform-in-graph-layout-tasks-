To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two distance measures. Since calculating all pairwise distances and correlations is computationally intensive and I cannot execute code, I will make an educated guess based on visual inspection and the general properties of the layouts.

Layout 2 appears to be a more organized and evenly spaced layout, resembling a chain-like structure that reflects the graph's structure. Layout 1 seems more scattered and less structured. Therefore, Layout 2 is more likely to preserve graph-theoretic distances better.
