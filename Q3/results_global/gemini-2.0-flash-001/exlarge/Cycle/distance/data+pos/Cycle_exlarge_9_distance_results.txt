To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. Since calculating this for all pairs of nodes is computationally expensive, we can approximate by comparing distances between some pairs of nodes. The graph data represents a path. Let's consider the distance between node 0 and node 77, which is 77. Also, the distance between node 0 and node 78 is 1.

Layout 1:
- Distance between node 0 and node 77: sqrt((0.08 - (-0.33))^2 + (-0.51 - (-0.21))^2) = sqrt(0.41^2 + (-0.3)^2) = sqrt(0.1681 + 0.09) = sqrt(0.2581) = 0.508
- Distance between node 0 and node 78: sqrt((0.08 - 0.22)^2 + (-0.51 - (-0.22))^2) = sqrt((-0.14)^2 + (-0.29)^2) = sqrt(0.0196 + 0.0841) = sqrt(0.1037) = 0.322

Layout 2:
- Distance between node 0 and node 77: sqrt((-0.49 - (-0.74))^2 + (-0.44 - (-0.4))^2) = sqrt(0.25^2 + (-0.04)^2) = sqrt(0.0625 + 0.0016) = sqrt(0.0641) = 0.253
- Distance between node 0 and node 78: sqrt((-0.49 - (-0.62))^2 + (-0.44 - (-0.43))^2) = sqrt(0.13^2 + (-0.01)^2) = sqrt(0.0169 + 0.0001) = sqrt(0.017) = 0.13

In Layout 1, the distance between nodes 0 and 77 (graph distance 77) is 0.508, and the distance between nodes 0 and 78 (graph distance 1) is 0.322.
In Layout 2, the distance between nodes 0 and 77 (graph distance 77) is 0.253, and the distance between nodes 0 and 78 (graph distance 1) is 0.13.

Let's consider another pair of nodes, 0 and 1 (graph distance 1).
Layout 1: sqrt((0.08 - (-0.37))^2 + (-0.51 - (-0.47))^2) = sqrt(0.45^2 + (-0.04)^2) = sqrt(0.2025 + 0.0016) = sqrt(0.2041) = 0.452
Layout 2: sqrt((-0.49 - (-0.42))^2 + (-0.44 - (-0.52))^2) = sqrt((-0.07)^2 + (0.08)^2) = sqrt(0.0049 + 0.0064) = sqrt(0.0113) = 0.106

It's difficult to definitively say which layout is better without more rigorous calculations. However, based on these few comparisons, Layout 1 seems to have a larger difference in Euclidean distance corresponding to a larger difference in graph distance.
