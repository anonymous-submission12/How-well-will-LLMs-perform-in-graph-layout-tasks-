To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two distance measures. Since manually computing and comparing these correlations is complex, I will make a qualitative assessment based on the node coordinates provided.

Layout 1 appears to be more scattered, with nodes distributed somewhat randomly in the 2D space. Layout 2 seems to arrange the nodes in a more linear or sequential fashion, which aligns better with the graph structure, which is primarily a long chain with one additional edge (0, 73). The chain-like structure in the graph suggests that nodes that are far apart in the graph should also be far apart in the layout. Layout 2 seems to achieve this better than Layout 1.

Therefore, Layout 2 likely better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
