The graph data represents a path graph. In a path graph, the graph-theoretic distance between two nodes is simply the absolute difference in their indices. We want to compare how well the Euclidean distance between nodes in each layout approximates this graph-theoretic distance. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are monotonically related to the graph-theoretic distances.

Layout 1 appears to be more spread out and less distorted than layout 2. Layout 2 seems to compress many nodes together. This suggests that layout 1 might better preserve graph-theoretic distances.

To confirm this, we can consider a few pairs of nodes and compare the ratio of their Euclidean distances to their graph-theoretic distances in both layouts. For example, let's compare nodes 0 and 76, and nodes 0 and 1.

In layout 1:
- Distance(0, 76) = sqrt((0.51-0.33)^2 + (0.04-0.25)^2) = sqrt(0.0324 + 0.0441) = sqrt(0.0765) = 0.2766
- Distance(0, 1) = sqrt((0.51-0.71)^2 + (0.04-(-0.23))^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 0.0729) = sqrt(0.1129) = 0.336

In layout 2:
- Distance(0, 76) = sqrt((0.45-0.47)^2 + (-0.78-(-0.87))^2) = sqrt(0.0004 + 0.0081) = sqrt(0.0085) = 0.092
- Distance(0, 1) = sqrt((0.45-0.39)^2 + (-0.78-(-0.7))^2) = sqrt(0.0036 + 0.0064) = sqrt(0.01) = 0.1

Graph-theoretic distance(0, 76) = 76
Graph-theoretic distance(0, 1) = 1

Ratio in layout 1:
- 0.2766 / 76 = 0.00364
- 0.336 / 1 = 0.336

Ratio in layout 2:
- 0.092 / 76 = 0.0012
- 0.1 / 1 = 0.1

The difference in ratios is smaller in layout 1 (0.336 - 0.00364 = 0.33236) than in layout 2 (0.1 - 0.0012 = 0.0988). This suggests that layout 1 is better at preserving graph-theoretic distance.
