The graph data represents a path. In an ideal layout that preserves graph-theoretic distance, the nodes would be placed along a line, equally spaced.

Layout 1 has nodes scattered somewhat randomly in 2D space. Layout 2 appears to place the nodes along a curve, but the spacing seems more uniform than in layout 1. Therefore, layout 2 is likely to better preserve graph-theoretic distance.
