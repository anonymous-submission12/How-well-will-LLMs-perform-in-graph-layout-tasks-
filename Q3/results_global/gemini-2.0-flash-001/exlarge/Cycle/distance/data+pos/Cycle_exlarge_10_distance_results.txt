Let's analyze how well each layout preserves graph-theoretic distances. The graph is a simple path. Ideally, the Euclidean distances between consecutive nodes in the layout should be roughly equal, and the overall layout should resemble a line. Deviations from this indicate distortions in preserving graph distances.

Layout 1 has nodes scattered somewhat randomly. Layout 2 appears to be a more linear layout, following the path structure of the graph more closely. Therefore, Layout 2 likely preserves graph-theoretic distances better than Layout 1.
