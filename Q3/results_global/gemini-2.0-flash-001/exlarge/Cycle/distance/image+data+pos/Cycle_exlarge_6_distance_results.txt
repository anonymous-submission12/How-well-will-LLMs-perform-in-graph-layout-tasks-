The graph data represents a path graph. Layout 2 clearly preserves the graph-theoretic distance better because the nodes are laid out in a sequential manner, reflecting the path structure. Layout 1 appears to be a more random layout, where nodes that are far apart in the graph are sometimes placed close together in the layout, and vice versa.
