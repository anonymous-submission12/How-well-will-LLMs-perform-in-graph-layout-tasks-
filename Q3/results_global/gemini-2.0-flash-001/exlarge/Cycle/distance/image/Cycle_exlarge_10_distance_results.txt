Based on the visual representation, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, many nodes are clustered together, making it difficult to discern the actual path length between them. Layout 2 spreads the nodes out more evenly, providing a clearer indication of the distance between nodes based on the path along the edges.
