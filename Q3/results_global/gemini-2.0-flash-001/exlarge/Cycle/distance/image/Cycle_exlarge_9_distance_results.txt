Layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, the nodes are scattered seemingly randomly, making it difficult to visually estimate the shortest path between any two nodes. Layout 2, on the other hand, arranges the nodes in a more structured manner, allowing for a better visual approximation of the graph distance.
