Based on the visual characteristics of the two layouts, the second layout (image 2) appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In the first layout (image 1), the edges are tangled and the spatial distances between nodes do not seem to reflect their actual graph-theoretic distances. In contrast, the second layout (image 2) shows a more structured arrangement where nodes that are close in the graph are also close in the layout.
