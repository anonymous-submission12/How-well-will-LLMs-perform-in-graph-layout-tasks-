Layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, many nodes are clustered together, making it difficult to visually estimate the actual path length between them in the graph. Layout 2 spreads the nodes out more evenly, giving a better sense of the graph's structure and distances.
