Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, I can make an educated guess based on the node positions. Layout 2 appears to arrange the nodes in a more organized fashion, resembling a chain-like structure, which generally leads to fewer crossings. Layout 1 seems more scattered.
