Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer edge crossings. However, based on a visual inspection of the node coordinates and edge list, layout 2 appears to have a more organized structure, potentially leading to fewer crossings. Layout 1 seems more scattered.
