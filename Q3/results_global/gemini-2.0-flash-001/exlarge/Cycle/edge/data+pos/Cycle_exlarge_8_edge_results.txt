Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, based on a visual assessment of the node coordinates and edge list, layout 2 appears to have a more organized structure, potentially leading to fewer crossings. The nodes seem to be arranged in a more linear or circular fashion, which often reduces edge intersections. Layout 1 seems more scattered.
