Without executing a complex graph crossing counting algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, based on a visual assessment of the node coordinates, layout 2 appears to be a more organized chain, while layout 1 has some edges that cut across the chain. Therefore, layout 2 likely has fewer crossings.
