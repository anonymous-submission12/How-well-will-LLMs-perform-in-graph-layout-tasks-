To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the original graph. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have Euclidean distances that more closely reflect the shortest path distances.

Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive and not feasible in this setting, I will make a qualitative assessment based on the general principles of graph layout.

Layout 1 appears to distribute the nodes more evenly around the central node (node 0). Layout 2 seems to cluster some nodes together while spreading others out. Without performing the calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which is better. However, a more even distribution, as seen in Layout 1, often leads to better preservation of graph-theoretic distances, especially when the graph is relatively dense.

Therefore, based on this qualitative assessment, I will choose Layout 1.
