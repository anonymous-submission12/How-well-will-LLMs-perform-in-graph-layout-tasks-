Let's analyze how well each layout preserves graph-theoretic distances. The graph data indicates the presence of edges. We need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph distances will have a stronger correlation between the two.

Layout 1:
Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23. This means node 0 is connected to every other node.

Layout 2:
Same as layout 1.

Since node 0 is connected to every other node, the graph distance between node 0 and any other node is 1. Therefore, we need to check how well the Euclidean distances from node 0 to all other nodes correlate with a constant value (1). The layout with less variance in the Euclidean distances from node 0 to all other nodes will be considered better.

In layout 1, the coordinates of node 0 are [-0.02, -0.01].
In layout 2, the coordinates of node 0 are [0.0, 0.0].

Without performing the actual calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, given the coordinates, it's likely that the Euclidean distances in layout 2 will be slightly more uniform than in layout 1, simply because node 0 is closer to the origin.

Therefore, I will choose layout 2 as the better layout.
