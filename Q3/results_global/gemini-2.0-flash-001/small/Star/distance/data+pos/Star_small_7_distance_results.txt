Let $G = (V, E)$ be the given graph with $V = \{0, 1, \dots, 26\}$ and $E = \{(0, 1), (0, 2), \dots, (0, 26)\}$. The graph-theoretic distance between two nodes $u$ and $v$ is the length of the shortest path between them. In this case, since node 0 is connected to all other nodes, the graph-theoretic distance between node 0 and any other node $i$ is 1, and the graph-theoretic distance between any two nodes $i$ and $j$ (where $i, j \ne 0$) is 2.

Let $d_G(u, v)$ denote the graph-theoretic distance between nodes $u$ and $v$. Let $d_L(u, v)$ denote the Euclidean distance between the coordinates of nodes $u$ and $v$ in a given layout. We want to find which layout better preserves the graph-theoretic distance. We can measure this by comparing $d_G(u, v)$ and $d_L(u, v)$ for all pairs of nodes. A good layout will have $d_L(u, v)$ be small when $d_G(u, v)$ is small, and $d_L(u, v)$ be large when $d_G(u, v)$ is large.

Since node 0 is central, we can look at the average distance from node 0 to all other nodes in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a more uniform distribution of nodes around node 0.

Layout 1:
The coordinates of node 0 are [-0.0, -0.01].
Layout 2:
The coordinates of node 0 are [0.0, 0.0].

We can calculate the sum of Euclidean distances from node 0 to all other nodes in each layout.

Layout 1:
$\sum_{i=1}^{26} d_L(0, i) \approx 14.88$

Layout 2:
$\sum_{i=1}^{26} d_L(0, i) \approx 15.25$

The sums are close. Let's consider the variance of the distances from node 0 to other nodes. A lower variance would indicate a more uniform distribution.

Layout 1: Variance $\approx 0.14$
Layout 2: Variance $\approx 0.13$

The variances are also close.

Let's consider the average distance between nodes that are not directly connected to each other (i.e., distance 2 in the graph). In this case, all nodes other than 0 are at distance 2 from each other.

It is difficult to make a definitive judgment without more sophisticated analysis. However, based on the slightly lower variance in distances from node 0, Layout 2 might be slightly better.
