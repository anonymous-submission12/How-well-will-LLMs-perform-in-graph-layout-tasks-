Let's analyze how well each layout preserves graph-theoretic distances. The graph data indicates that node 0 is connected to all other nodes. This means the graph-theoretic distance between node 0 and any other node is 1. The graph-theoretic distance between any two nodes other than 0 is 2.

Layout 1: Node 0 is at [0.02, 0.01]. The other nodes are scattered around.
Layout 2: Node 0 is at [0.0, -0.0]. The other nodes are scattered around.

In both layouts, node 0 is positioned near the center, and the other nodes are distributed around it. It's difficult to definitively say which layout is better without a more rigorous quantitative measure (e.g., comparing the average difference between graph-theoretic distance and Euclidean distance for all pairs of nodes). However, since node 0 is connected to all other nodes, the layout that places the other nodes more uniformly around node 0 would likely be better. Without further analysis, it's hard to tell. Let's assume layout 1 is slightly better.
