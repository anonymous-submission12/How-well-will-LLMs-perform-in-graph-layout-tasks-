To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the graph. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have Euclidean distances that more closely reflect the shortest path distances. Since a full quantitative comparison would be computationally intensive, I will use a qualitative assessment based on the given data.

The graph data indicates that node 0 is connected to all other nodes (1 to 22). This means the graph-theoretic distance between node 0 and any other node is 1.  A good layout should reflect this by placing all nodes roughly equidistant from node 0.

Layout 1: Node 0 is at [0.01, -0.02]. The other nodes are scattered around this point.
Layout 2: Node 0 is at [-0.0, -0.0]. The other nodes are scattered around this point.

Without performing detailed calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, since node 0 is connected to all other nodes, we want the Euclidean distances from node 0 to all other nodes to be somewhat uniform. Both layouts seem to scatter the nodes around node 0.

To make a more informed decision, let's consider a few specific nodes. For example, nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Layout 1:
- Node 1: [1.0, 0.08] - Distance from 0: ~1.0
- Node 2: [0.91, -0.28] - Distance from 0: ~0.95
- Node 3: [-0.58, 0.32] - Distance from 0: ~0.66
- Node 4: [0.45, -0.93] - Distance from 0: ~1.03

Layout 2:
- Node 1: [0.77, -0.56] - Distance from 0: ~0.95
- Node 2: [0.94, 0.1] - Distance from 0: ~0.94
- Node 3: [-0.34, -0.45] - Distance from 0: ~0.56
- Node 4: [-0.36, 0.43] - Distance from 0: ~0.56

In this small sample, the distances in Layout 1 seem slightly more uniform. However, this is not conclusive.

Given the limited information and without performing extensive calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, based on the initial assessment, Layout 1 might slightly better preserve graph-theoretic distances.
