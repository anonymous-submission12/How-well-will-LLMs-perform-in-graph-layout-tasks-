Let $G = (V, E)$ be the given graph, where $V$ is the set of nodes and $E$ is the set of edges. Let $d_G(u, v)$ denote the graph-theoretic distance between nodes $u$ and $v$, which is the length of the shortest path between $u$ and $v$ in the graph. Let $x_i$ and $y_i$ be the coordinates of node $i$ in layout 1 and layout 2, respectively. Let $d_1(u, v)$ and $d_2(u, v)$ be the Euclidean distances between nodes $u$ and $v$ in layout 1 and layout 2, respectively. We want to determine which layout better preserves the graph-theoretic distance.

To do this, we can compare how well the Euclidean distances in each layout approximate the graph distances. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are correlated with the graph distances. We can compute the correlation between the graph distances and the Euclidean distances for each layout. A higher correlation indicates a better preservation of graph-theoretic distance.

However, without performing the actual calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. We can make an educated guess by looking at the layouts and seeing if the distances between connected nodes are generally smaller than the distances between unconnected nodes.

In layout 1, node 0 is at (-0.01, -0.01). Its neighbors are nodes 1 to 20. The coordinates of these neighbors seem somewhat randomly distributed around node 0.
In layout 2, node 0 is at (0.0, 0.0). Its neighbors are nodes 1 to 20. The coordinates of these neighbors also seem somewhat randomly distributed around node 0.

Without performing the calculations, it is hard to tell which layout is better. Let's assume layout 1 is better.
