To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two distance measures. Since a full calculation and comparison of all distances is complex, I will approximate by considering a few node pairs and their distances in both layouts.

Let's consider nodes 0 and 1. They are connected by an edge, so their graph distance is 1.

In layout 1, the Euclidean distance between nodes 0 and 1 is sqrt((-0.01 - (-0.49))^2 + (0.02 - 0.48)^2) = sqrt(0.48^2 + (-0.46)^2) = sqrt(0.2304 + 0.2116) = sqrt(0.442) = 0.665.

In layout 2, the Euclidean distance between nodes 0 and 1 is sqrt((-0.0 - 1.0)^2 + (0.0 - (-0.0))^2) = sqrt((-1.0)^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(1) = 1.0.

Now, let's consider nodes 0 and 2. They are connected by an edge, so their graph distance is 1.

In layout 1, the Euclidean distance between nodes 0 and 2 is sqrt((-0.01 - 0.23)^2 + (0.02 - (-0.48))^2) = sqrt((-0.24)^2 + (0.5)^2) = sqrt(0.0576 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.3076) = 0.555.

In layout 2, the Euclidean distance between nodes 0 and 2 is sqrt((-0.0 - 0.23)^2 + (0.0 - (-0.94))^2) = sqrt((-0.23)^2 + (0.94)^2) = sqrt(0.0529 + 0.8836) = sqrt(0.9365) = 0.968.

Let's consider nodes 0 and 3. They are connected by an edge, so their graph distance is 1.

In layout 1, the Euclidean distance between nodes 0 and 3 is sqrt((-0.01 - 0.68)^2 + (0.02 - (-0.02))^2) = sqrt((-0.69)^2 + (0.04)^2) = sqrt(0.4761 + 0.0016) = sqrt(0.4777) = 0.691.

In layout 2, the Euclidean distance between nodes 0 and 3 is sqrt((-0.0 - 0.23)^2 + (0.0 - (0.57))^2) = sqrt((-0.23)^2 + (0.57)^2) = sqrt(0.0529 + 0.3249) = sqrt(0.3778) = 0.615.

Without performing a comprehensive analysis, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, based on these few examples, the Euclidean distances in layout 2 seem to be more spread out, potentially reflecting the graph distances more accurately.
