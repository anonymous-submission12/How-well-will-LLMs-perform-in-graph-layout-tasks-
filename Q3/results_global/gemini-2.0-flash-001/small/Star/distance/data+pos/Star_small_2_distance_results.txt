To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two distance measures. Since a full calculation and comparison of all distances is complex, I will estimate based on visual inspection and a few key node relationships.

Layout 1:
- Node 0 is central.
- Nodes 1, 4, 7, 14, 15, 19 are relatively far from 0.
- Nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21 are also relatively far from 0.

Layout 2:
- Node 0 is central.
- Nodes are distributed somewhat evenly.

The graph data indicates that node 0 is connected to all other nodes. This means the graph distance between node 0 and any other node is 1.  Ideally, the layout should reflect this by placing all nodes roughly equidistant from node 0.

By visual inspection, Layout 1 seems to distribute the nodes more randomly around node 0, while Layout 2 appears to spread the nodes more evenly. This suggests that Layout 2 might better reflect the uniform graph distance of 1 from node 0 to all other nodes.

Therefore, I estimate that Layout 2 better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
