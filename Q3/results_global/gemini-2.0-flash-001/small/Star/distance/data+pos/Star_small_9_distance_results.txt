To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph distances. Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, I will estimate by considering a few key properties.

Layout 1 seems to spread the nodes more evenly across the space. Layout 2 appears to cluster some nodes together while leaving others relatively isolated. Given the graph connectivity, Layout 1 is more likely to preserve graph-theoretic distances better because nodes connected in the graph are more likely to be closer in the layout.
