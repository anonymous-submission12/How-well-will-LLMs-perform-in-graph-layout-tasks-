The graph data represents a star graph with node 0 connected to all other nodes. We want to determine which layout better preserves the graph-theoretic distance. In a star graph, the distance between the central node (0) and any other node is 1, and the distance between any two non-central nodes is 2.

Layout 1:
Node 0 is at [-0.0, -0.02]. The other nodes are scattered around it.

Layout 2:
Node 0 is at [0.0, 0.0]. The other nodes are scattered around it.

We can calculate the Euclidean distances between node 0 and all other nodes in both layouts. A layout that places all nodes connected to node 0 at roughly the same distance from node 0 will better preserve the graph-theoretic distance. Also, the distances between non-central nodes should be relatively large.

Without performing the actual calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, since both layouts seem to scatter the nodes around the central node, it's likely that the differences in how well they preserve graph-theoretic distance are small.

Let's consider the distances from node 0. In layout 1, node 1 is at (0.91, 0.26), distance is sqrt(0.91^2 + 0.26^2) = 0.95. In layout 2, node 1 is at (0.81, -0.6), distance is sqrt(0.81^2 + (-0.6)^2) = 1.01.

Since we don't have a clear winner without doing extensive calculations, and the layouts appear similar in their distribution, let's make an educated guess. Layout 1 might be slightly better because the coordinates of node 0 are closer to (0,0) than in layout 2.
