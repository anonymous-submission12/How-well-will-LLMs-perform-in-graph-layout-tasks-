Both layouts appear to be star graphs, where all nodes are connected to a central node. In a star graph, the graph-theoretic distance between any two non-central nodes is always 2 (one hop to the center, one hop to the other node). The distance between the center and any other node is 1.

In both layouts, the Euclidean distance between the non-central nodes and the central node is roughly proportional to the graph-theoretic distance of 1. The Euclidean distance between any two non-central nodes is not directly proportional to the graph-theoretic distance of 2, but this is inherent to representing graph-theoretic distance in a 2D layout of a star graph.

However, the first layout seems to have more variation in the Euclidean distances between the central node and the other nodes. The second layout appears to have a more uniform distribution of nodes around the center, making the Euclidean distances more consistent with the graph-theoretic distance of 1.

Therefore, the second layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
