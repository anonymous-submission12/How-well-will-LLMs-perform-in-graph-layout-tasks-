Both layouts appear to be radial layouts of a star graph. In a star graph, all nodes are directly connected to a central node. Therefore, the graph-theoretic distance between any two non-central nodes is 2 (one hop to the center, one hop to the other node). The distance between the center and any other node is 1.

In both layouts, the nodes are arranged radially around a central node. The Euclidean distance between nodes in both layouts roughly corresponds to the graph-theoretic distance. However, the second layout seems to distribute the nodes more evenly around the central node, which might give a slightly better visual representation of the graph-theoretic distances.

Therefore, layout 2 is slightly better.
