Both layouts appear to be radial layouts of a star graph. In a star graph, all nodes are directly connected to a central node. Therefore, the graph-theoretic distance between any two non-central nodes is 2 (one hop to the center, one hop to the other node). The distance between the center and any other node is 1.

Both layouts visually represent this structure well. The Euclidean distance between nodes in both layouts roughly corresponds to the graph-theoretic distance. However, layout 2 has a slightly more even distribution of the outer nodes, which might make it slightly better at preserving graph-theoretic distance.
