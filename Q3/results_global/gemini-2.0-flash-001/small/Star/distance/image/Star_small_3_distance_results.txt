Both layouts appear to be star graphs, where all nodes are connected to a central node. In a star graph, the graph-theoretic distance between any two non-central nodes is always 2 (one hop to the center, one hop to the other node). The Euclidean distance in both layouts seems to reflect this structure reasonably well. Without further information or a specific metric to evaluate the preservation of graph-theoretic distance, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, since both layouts are very similar and represent the star graph structure well, I will arbitrarily choose the first one.
