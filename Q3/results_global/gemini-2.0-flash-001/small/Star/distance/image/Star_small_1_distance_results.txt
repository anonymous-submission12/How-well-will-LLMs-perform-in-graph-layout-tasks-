Both layouts appear to be radial layouts of the same star graph. In a star graph, all nodes are directly connected to a central node. Therefore, the graph-theoretic distance between any two non-central nodes is 2, and the distance between the central node and any other node is 1. Both layouts visually represent this structure well, with all nodes connected to a central node. The Euclidean distances between nodes in both layouts seem to be arranged to reflect the graph-theoretic distances. Therefore, both layouts preserve graph-theoretic distance equally well.
