Both layouts appear to be radial layouts of a star graph. In a star graph, all nodes are connected to a central node. The graph-theoretic distance between any two non-central nodes is 2 (one hop to the center, one hop to the other node). The distance between the center and any other node is 1.

In both layouts, the nodes are arranged radially around a central node. The Euclidean distance between nodes in both layouts seems to roughly correspond to the graph-theoretic distance. However, layout 2 appears to have a slightly more even distribution of nodes around the center, which might make it slightly better at preserving graph-theoretic distance.
