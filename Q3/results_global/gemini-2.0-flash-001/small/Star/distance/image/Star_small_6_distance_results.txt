Both layouts appear to be radial layouts of a star graph. In a star graph, all nodes are directly connected to a central node. Therefore, the graph-theoretic distance between any two non-central nodes is 2, and the distance between the central node and any other node is 1. Both layouts visually represent this structure well. However, the second layout seems to distribute the outer nodes more evenly, which might give a slightly better visual representation of the graph-theoretic distances.
