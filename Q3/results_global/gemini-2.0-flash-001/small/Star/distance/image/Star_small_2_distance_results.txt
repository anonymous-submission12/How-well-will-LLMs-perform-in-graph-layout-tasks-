Both layouts appear to be radial layouts of a star graph. In a star graph, all peripheral nodes are equidistant from the central node, and the distance between any two peripheral nodes is 2. Both layouts visually represent this structure reasonably well. However, the second layout has a slightly more even distribution of the peripheral nodes around the central node, which might make it slightly better at preserving the graph-theoretic distance.
