Both layouts appear to be the same. In both layouts, all nodes are connected to a central node. Therefore, the graph-theoretic distance between any two non-central nodes is 2 (one hop to the center, one hop to the other node). The Euclidean distance in both layouts seems to reflect this, as all non-central nodes are roughly equidistant from the center. Thus, both layouts preserve graph-theoretic distance equally well.
