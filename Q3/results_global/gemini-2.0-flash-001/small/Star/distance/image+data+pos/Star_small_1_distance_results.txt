The graph data indicates that node 0 is connected to all other nodes. In both layouts, node 0 is placed at the center, and other nodes are placed around it. The main difference between the two layouts is the arrangement of the nodes around node 0.

To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to consider how well the Euclidean distance between nodes reflects the graph distance. Since all nodes are directly connected to node 0, the graph distance between node 0 and any other node is 1. The graph distance between any two nodes other than node 0 is 2 (going through node 0).

In the first layout, the nodes seem to be distributed more evenly around node 0. In the second layout, there seems to be some clustering of nodes. The more even distribution in the first layout might better reflect the graph distances, as it avoids clumping nodes together that are not directly connected.

Therefore, layout 1 likely better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
