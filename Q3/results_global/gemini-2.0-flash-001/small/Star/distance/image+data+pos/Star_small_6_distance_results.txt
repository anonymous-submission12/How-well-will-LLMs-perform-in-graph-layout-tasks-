The graph data shows that node 0 is connected to all other nodes. In the first layout, the nodes are arranged around node 0 in a more or less uniform manner. In the second layout, the nodes are also arranged around node 0, but the distribution appears less uniform. Since all nodes are one hop away from node 0, the first layout, which distributes the nodes more evenly, likely preserves graph-theoretic distance better.
