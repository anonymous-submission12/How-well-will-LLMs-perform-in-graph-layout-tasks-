The graph data indicates that node 0 is connected to all other nodes. In an ideal layout that preserves graph-theoretic distance, all nodes should be placed equidistant from node 0.

Layout 1 appears to distribute the nodes more evenly around node 0, while layout 2 seems to have some clustering. Therefore, layout 1 likely preserves graph-theoretic distance better.
