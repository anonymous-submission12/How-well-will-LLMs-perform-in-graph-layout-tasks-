The graph data indicates that node 0 is connected to all other nodes. In an ideal layout that preserves graph-theoretic distance, all nodes should be placed equidistant from node 0.

Layout 1 appears to be a radial layout with node 0 at the center, and the other nodes distributed around it. Layout 2 also appears to be a radial layout, but the nodes are not as evenly distributed around node 0 as in Layout 1.

Therefore, Layout 1 better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
