The graph data indicates that node 0 is connected to all other nodes. Layout 1 appears to place node 0 in the center, with all other nodes arranged around it. Layout 2 also places node 0 in the center with all other nodes arranged around it. Both layouts are radial layouts. Without further analysis, it's difficult to definitively say which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance. However, since both layouts are radial and visually similar, it's likely that their preservation of graph-theoretic distance is comparable.
