The first layout appears to be a radial layout, where nodes are positioned around a central node. The second layout seems to be a force-directed layout, where nodes are positioned based on attractive and repulsive forces.

In a radial layout, nodes directly connected to the center are placed at varying distances, but the graph distance from the center is always 1. The Euclidean distance in the layout directly reflects this graph distance. However, the distances between non-central nodes are not well-preserved.

In a force-directed layout, the Euclidean distances between nodes are intended to reflect the graph distances. Nodes that are close in the graph are placed close in the layout, and nodes that are far in the graph are placed far in the layout.

Since the graph is a star graph, the first layout (radial) is likely to preserve graph-theoretic distance better.
