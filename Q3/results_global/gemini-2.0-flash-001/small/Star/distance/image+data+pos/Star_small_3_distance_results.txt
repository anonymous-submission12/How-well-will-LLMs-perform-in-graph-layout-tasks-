Based on the visual layouts, it's difficult to definitively say which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance without quantitative analysis. However, I can make an educated guess based on the distribution of nodes.

In Layout 1, the nodes seem more evenly distributed around the central node (node 0). In Layout 2, there appears to be some clustering, and the distribution seems less uniform.

A more even distribution, as seen in Layout 1, generally suggests a better preservation of graph-theoretic distance, as nodes that are further away in the graph are also likely to be further away in the layout.
