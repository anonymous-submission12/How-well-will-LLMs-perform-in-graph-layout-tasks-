The graph data indicates that node 0 is connected to all other nodes. In layout 1, the nodes are arranged somewhat randomly around node 0. In layout 2, the nodes are also arranged around node 0, but the distribution seems more uniform. Since all nodes are connected to node 0, the graph-theoretic distance between any node and node 0 is 1. The graph-theoretic distance between any two nodes other than node 0 is 2.

Layout 1: The Euclidean distances between node 0 and other nodes vary significantly. Some nodes are very close to node 0, while others are far away. This does not preserve the graph-theoretic distance well.

Layout 2: The Euclidean distances between node 0 and other nodes are more uniform compared to layout 1. This better reflects the fact that all nodes are one hop away from node 0.

Therefore, layout 2 better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
