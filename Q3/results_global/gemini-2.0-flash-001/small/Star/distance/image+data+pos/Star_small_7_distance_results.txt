The graph data indicates that node 0 is connected to all other nodes. In an ideal layout that preserves graph-theoretic distance, all nodes should be placed equidistant from node 0.

Layout 1 appears to distribute the nodes more evenly around node 0 compared to Layout 2. Layout 2 seems to cluster some nodes closer to node 0 than others. Therefore, Layout 1 better preserves the graph-theoretic distance.
