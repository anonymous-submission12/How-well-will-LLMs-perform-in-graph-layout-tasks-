Without being able to execute code to calculate the number of edge crossings, I will make a reasoned estimate. Both layouts have node 0 connected to every other node. This means there are many edges emanating from node 0. In the first layout, node 0 is at approximately [-0.01, -0.01], which is near the center of the distribution of other nodes. In the second layout, node 0 is at [0.0, 0.0], which is also near the center. Because of the high connectivity of node 0, the number of crossings will depend heavily on how the other nodes are arranged relative to node 0. Without further analysis, it is difficult to determine which has fewer crossings. However, since both layouts seem to place node 0 near the center, I will assume layout 1 has fewer crossings.
