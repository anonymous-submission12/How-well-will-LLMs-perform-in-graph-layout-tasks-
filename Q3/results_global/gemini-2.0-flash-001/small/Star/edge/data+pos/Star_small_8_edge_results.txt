Without executing a crossing counting algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer edge crossings. However, based on a visual estimation of the node positions, layout 2 appears to have a more organized structure compared to layout 1. Therefore, I'll predict that layout 2 has fewer crossings.

{
"Answer": "2"
