Without executing a crossing counting algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer edge crossings. However, I can provide an educated guess based on a visual assessment of the node positions relative to their connections.

Layout 1 appears to have a central node (node 0) connected to many other nodes distributed somewhat randomly. This configuration is prone to many crossings.

Layout 2 also has node 0 connected to all other nodes. The distribution of the other nodes seems a bit more organized, potentially leading to fewer crossings.

Therefore, my educated guess is that Layout 2 has fewer crossings.
