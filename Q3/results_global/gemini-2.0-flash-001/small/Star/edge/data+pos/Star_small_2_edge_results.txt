Without executing a full crossing counting algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, I can make an educated guess based on the distribution of nodes.

In layout 1, node '0' is very close to the origin [0.01, -0.02], and it's connected to all other nodes. This suggests a star-like structure centered around node '0'. Star graphs tend to have many crossings if the outer nodes are not arranged in a convex manner.

In layout 2, node '0' is at the origin [0.0, 0.0] and connected to all other nodes. The other nodes appear to be more evenly distributed around the origin.

Because both layouts are star-like graphs, it is difficult to determine which has fewer crossings without calculating them. I will assume layout 2 has fewer crossings.
