Without executing a complex graph crossing counting algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, I can make an educated guess based on the distribution of nodes. Layout 2 appears to have nodes more evenly distributed around node 0, while layout 1 seems to have some clustering. More even distribution often leads to fewer crossings. Therefore, I will guess that layout 2 has fewer crossings.
