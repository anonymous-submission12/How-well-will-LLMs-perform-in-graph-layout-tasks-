Based on the visual representation of the graph layouts, layout 2 appears to better preserve the graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, nodes that are far apart in the graph (e.g., node 0 and node 23) are placed relatively close to each other in the layout. In layout 2, the nodes are arranged in a more linear fashion, which better reflects the path distances between nodes in the graph.
