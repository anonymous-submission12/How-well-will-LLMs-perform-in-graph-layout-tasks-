The graph data describes a grid-like structure. Layout 2 visually represents this grid structure more clearly than layout 1. In layout 1, the nodes are scattered and the grid structure is not immediately apparent. In layout 2, the nodes are arranged in a more regular grid-like fashion, which better reflects the graph-theoretic distances between nodes.
