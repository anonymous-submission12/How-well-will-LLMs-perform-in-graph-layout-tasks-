Based on the visual representation of the two layouts, layout 2 appears to better preserve the graph-theoretic distance. In layout 2, nodes that are close in the graph (i.e., connected by an edge or a short path) are also placed close to each other in the layout. This is evident in the grid-like structure, where adjacent nodes are consistently placed next to each other. In contrast, layout 1 seems to have nodes scattered more randomly, with some adjacent nodes being placed far apart.
