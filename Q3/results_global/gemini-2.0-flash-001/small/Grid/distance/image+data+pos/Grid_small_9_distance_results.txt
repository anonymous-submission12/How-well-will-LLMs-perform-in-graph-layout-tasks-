Based on the visual representation of the graph layouts, layout 2 appears to better preserve the graph-theoretic distance. In layout 2, nodes that are close in the graph (small graph-theoretic distance) are also placed close to each other in the layout. This is evident from the relatively uniform spacing and arrangement of nodes along the edges. In contrast, layout 1 has nodes that are close in the graph placed far apart in the layout, and vice versa.
