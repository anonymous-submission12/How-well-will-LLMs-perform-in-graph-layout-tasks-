The graph data represents a graph with 24 nodes and 34 edges. The edges connect consecutive nodes (0-1, 1-2, etc.) and also connect nodes with a difference of 12 (0-12, 1-13, etc.). This structure suggests a grid-like or ladder-like graph.

Layout 1: The node coordinates seem to place nodes in a somewhat distorted grid or ladder arrangement.

Layout 2: The node coordinates also seem to place nodes in a distorted grid or ladder arrangement, but perhaps with more compression.

To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the Euclidean distances between connected nodes in each layout with the graph-theoretic distances. Since a full calculation is not feasible, we can look for obvious distortions.

In Layout 1, nodes 0 to 11 form a chain, and nodes 12 to 23 form another chain. The edges connecting these chains are 0-12, 1-13, etc. The coordinates appear somewhat scattered, but the general structure is maintained.

In Layout 2, the coordinates appear more compressed, especially in the y-direction. This compression might distort the graph-theoretic distances more significantly.

Without performing detailed calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, based on visual inspection, Layout 1 seems to maintain the relative distances between connected nodes more faithfully than Layout 2, which appears compressed.
