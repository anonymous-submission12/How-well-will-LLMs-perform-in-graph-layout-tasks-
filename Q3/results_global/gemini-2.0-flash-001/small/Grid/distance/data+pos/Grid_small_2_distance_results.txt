To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances between those nodes in the graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph distances.  Since a full quantitative comparison would be computationally intensive, I will make a qualitative assessment based on the structure of the graph and the layouts.

The graph is a grid-like structure. Layout 2 appears to arrange the nodes in a more grid-like fashion, visually resembling the graph's connectivity. Layout 1 seems more compressed and less structured. Therefore, Layout 2 likely preserves graph-theoretic distances better.
