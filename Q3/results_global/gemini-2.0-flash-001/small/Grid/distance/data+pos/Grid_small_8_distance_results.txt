To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two distance measures. Since a full calculation of all pairwise distances and their correlation is computationally intensive and not feasible in this setting, I will approximate by considering a few node pairs and qualitatively assessing which layout seems to better reflect the graph distances in Euclidean space.

Consider nodes 0 and 6. The graph distance between them is 6.
In layout 1, the Euclidean distance between node 0 (0.91, -0.14) and node 6 (0.27, 0.04) is approximately sqrt((0.91-0.27)^2 + (-0.14-0.04)^2) = sqrt(0.64^2 + (-0.18)^2) = sqrt(0.4096 + 0.0324) = sqrt(0.442) = 0.66.
In layout 2, the Euclidean distance between node 0 (0.81, -0.47) and node 6 (-0.29, -0.29) is approximately sqrt((0.81+0.29)^2 + (-0.47+0.29)^2) = sqrt(1.1^2 + (-0.18)^2) = sqrt(1.21 + 0.0324) = sqrt(1.2424) = 1.11.

Consider nodes 0 and 27. The graph distance between them is 27.
In layout 1, the Euclidean distance between node 0 (0.91, -0.14) and node 27 (-0.91, 0.41) is approximately sqrt((0.91+0.91)^2 + (-0.14-0.41)^2) = sqrt(1.82^2 + (-0.55)^2) = sqrt(3.3124 + 0.3025) = sqrt(3.6149) = 1.90.
In layout 2, the Euclidean distance between node 0 (0.81, -0.47) and node 27 (-0.57, 1.0) is approximately sqrt((0.81+0.57)^2 + (-0.47-1.0)^2) = sqrt(1.38^2 + (-1.47)^2) = sqrt(1.9044 + 2.1609) = sqrt(4.0653) = 2.02.

Consider nodes 13 and 14. The graph distance between them is 14.
In layout 1, the Euclidean distance between node 13 (-0.51, 0.5) and node 14 (0.88, 0.26) is approximately sqrt((-0.51-0.88)^2 + (0.5-0.26)^2) = sqrt((-1.39)^2 + (0.24)^2) = sqrt(1.9321 + 0.0576) = sqrt(1.9897) = 1.41.
In layout 2, the Euclidean distance between node 13 (-0.54, 0.87) and node 14 (0.84, -0.6) is approximately sqrt((-0.54-0.84)^2 + (0.87+0.6)^2) = sqrt((-1.38)^2 + (1.47)^2) = sqrt(1.9044 + 2.1609) = sqrt(4.0653) = 2.02.

Based on these observations, layout 1 seems to preserve the relative distances better. As the graph distance increases, the Euclidean distance also increases, but not as much in layout 1 as in layout 2.
