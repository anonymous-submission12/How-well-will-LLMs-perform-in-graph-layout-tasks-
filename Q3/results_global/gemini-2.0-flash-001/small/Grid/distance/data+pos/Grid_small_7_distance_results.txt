To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two distance measures. Since a full calculation and comparison of all pairwise distances would be computationally intensive, we can consider a few representative node pairs and compare how well their graph distances are reflected in the Euclidean distances in each layout.

Let's consider nodes 0 and 6. The shortest path between them in the graph is 0-1-2-3-4-5-6, which has a length of 6.

Layout 1:
Node 0: [-0.18, 0.04]
Node 6: [-1.0, -0.05]
Euclidean distance: sqrt((-1.0 - (-0.18))^2 + (-0.05 - 0.04)^2) = sqrt((-0.82)^2 + (-0.09)^2) = sqrt(0.6724 + 0.0081) = sqrt(0.6805) = 0.8249

Layout 2:
Node 0: [0.26, 1.0]
Node 6: [0.66, -0.88]
Euclidean distance: sqrt((0.66 - 0.26)^2 + (-0.88 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt((0.4)^2 + (-1.88)^2) = sqrt(0.16 + 3.5344) = sqrt(3.6944) = 1.9221

Now let's consider nodes 0 and 27. A possible shortest path is 0-7-14-21...27. The graph distance is 14.

Layout 1:
Node 0: [-0.18, 0.04]
Node 27: [0.34, -0.78]
Euclidean distance: sqrt((0.34 - (-0.18))^2 + (-0.78 - 0.04)^2) = sqrt((0.52)^2 + (-0.82)^2) = sqrt(0.2704 + 0.6724) = sqrt(0.9428) = 0.9710

Layout 2:
Node 0: [0.26, 1.0]
Node 27: [-0.23, -0.79]
Euclidean distance: sqrt((-0.23 - 0.26)^2 + (-0.79 - 1.0)^2) = sqrt((-0.49)^2 + (-1.79)^2) = sqrt(0.2401 + 3.2041) = sqrt(3.4442) = 1.8559

In Layout 2, the Euclidean distances seem to increase more consistently with the graph distances compared to Layout 1. Layout 1 seems to compress the distances. Therefore, Layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distances.
