To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two types of distances. Since a full calculation of all pairwise distances and their correlation is complex, we can approximate by comparing a few key distances.

Let's consider the graph distance between nodes 0 and 6, which is 6.
Layout 1:
Node 0: [-0.78, -0.4]
Node 6: [0.78, -0.46]
Euclidean distance: sqrt((0.78 - (-0.78))^2 + (-0.46 - (-0.4))^2) = sqrt(1.56^2 + (-0.06)^2) = sqrt(2.4336 + 0.0036) = sqrt(2.4372) = 1.56

Layout 2:
Node 0: [0.35, -0.99]
Node 6: [-0.72, 0.78]
Euclidean distance: sqrt((-0.72 - 0.35)^2 + (0.78 - (-0.99))^2) = sqrt((-1.07)^2 + (1.77)^2) = sqrt(1.1449 + 3.1329) = sqrt(4.2778) = 2.07

Now let's consider the graph distance between nodes 0 and 20, which is 20.
Layout 1:
Node 0: [-0.78, -0.4]
Node 20: [0.94, -0.49]
Euclidean distance: sqrt((0.94 - (-0.78))^2 + (-0.49 - (-0.4))^2) = sqrt(1.72^2 + (-0.09)^2) = sqrt(2.9584 + 0.0081) = sqrt(2.9665) = 1.72

Layout 2:
Node 0: [0.35, -0.99]
Node 20: [-0.29, 1.0]
Euclidean distance: sqrt((-0.29 - 0.35)^2 + (1.0 - (-0.99))^2) = sqrt((-0.64)^2 + (1.99)^2) = sqrt(0.4096 + 3.9601) = sqrt(4.3697) = 2.09

In Layout 1, a graph distance of 6 corresponds to a Euclidean distance of 1.56, and a graph distance of 20 corresponds to a Euclidean distance of 1.72.
In Layout 2, a graph distance of 6 corresponds to a Euclidean distance of 2.07, and a graph distance of 20 corresponds to a Euclidean distance of 2.09.

Layout 2 seems to show a better preservation of graph distance, as the Euclidean distances increase more consistently with the graph distances.
