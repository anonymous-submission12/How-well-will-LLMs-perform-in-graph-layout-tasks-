To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two types of distances.  Since a full calculation of all pairwise distances and their correlation is computationally intensive and not feasible in this setting, I will estimate based on visual inspection and a few key distance comparisons.

Layout 1 appears to compress the graph more towards the center. Layout 2 seems to spread the nodes out more evenly. Let's consider the graph distance between nodes 0 and 5, which is 5.

In Layout 1, the Euclidean distance between nodes 0 and 5 seems relatively small.
In Layout 2, the Euclidean distance between nodes 0 and 5 seems larger.

Similarly, consider the graph distance between nodes 24 and 29, which is 5.

In Layout 1, the Euclidean distance between nodes 24 and 29 seems relatively small.
In Layout 2, the Euclidean distance between nodes 24 and 29 seems larger.

Based on this qualitative assessment, Layout 2 appears to better reflect the graph distances in its Euclidean distances. The nodes are more spread out, and nodes that are far apart in the graph are also farther apart in the layout. Layout 1 seems to compress the nodes more, potentially distorting the graph distances.
