To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have Euclidean distances that more closely correlate with the graph distances. Since a full calculation and comparison of all pairwise distances would be computationally intensive without code execution, we can approximate by comparing a few example distances.

Let's consider the graph distance between nodes 0 and 6, which is 6.
Let's also consider the graph distance between nodes 0 and 21, which is 11.

Layout 1:
- Distance between 0 and 6: sqrt((0.89 - (-0.99))^2 + (0.23 - (-0.29))^2) = sqrt(1.88^2 + 0.52^2) = sqrt(3.5344 + 0.2704) = sqrt(3.8048) = 1.95
- Distance between 0 and 21: sqrt((-0.96 - (-0.99))^2 + (0.53 - (-0.29))^2) = sqrt(0.03^2 + 0.82^2) = sqrt(0.0009 + 0.6724) = sqrt(0.6733) = 0.82

Layout 2:
- Distance between 0 and 6: sqrt((-0.27 - 1.0)^2 + (-0.01 - 0.32)^2) = sqrt((-1.27)^2 + (-0.33)^2) = sqrt(1.6129 + 0.1089) = sqrt(1.7218) = 1.31
- Distance between 0 and 21: sqrt((-0.6 - 1.0)^2 + (-0.83 - 0.32)^2) = sqrt((-1.6)^2 + (-1.15)^2) = sqrt(2.56 + 1.3225) = sqrt(3.8825) = 1.97

Now, let's normalize the distances by dividing by the graph distance:

Layout 1:
- 0 to 6: 1.95 / 6 = 0.325
- 0 to 21: 0.82 / 11 = 0.075

Layout 2:
- 0 to 6: 1.31 / 6 = 0.218
- 0 to 21: 1.97 / 11 = 0.179

The normalized distances in Layout 2 are more consistent than in Layout 1. This suggests that Layout 2 might be better at preserving graph-theoretic distances.
