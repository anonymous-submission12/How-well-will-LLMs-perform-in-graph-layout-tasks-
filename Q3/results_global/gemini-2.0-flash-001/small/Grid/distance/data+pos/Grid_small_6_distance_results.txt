To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances between those nodes in the graph. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have Euclidean distances that more closely reflect the shortest path distances.

Since a full calculation of all shortest paths and Euclidean distances is computationally intensive and not feasible in this setting, we can consider a few representative node pairs and compare the ratios of their Euclidean distances to their shortest path distances in each layout.  If the ratios are more consistent across different node pairs for one layout compared to the other, that layout is likely better at preserving graph-theoretic distance.

Let's consider nodes 0 and 23, which are at opposite ends of the graph. The shortest path distance between them is 23.

In layout 1, the Euclidean distance between nodes 0 and 23 is approximately sqrt((0.7-0.24)^2 + (0.51 - (-0.01))^2) = sqrt(0.46^2 + 0.52^2) = sqrt(0.2116 + 0.2704) = sqrt(0.482) = 0.694. The ratio is 0.694/23 = 0.030.

In layout 2, the Euclidean distance between nodes 0 and 23 is approximately sqrt((-0.45 - (-0.02))^2 + (0.6 - (-0.99))^2) = sqrt((-0.43)^2 + (1.59)^2) = sqrt(0.1849 + 2.5281) = sqrt(2.713) = 1.647. The ratio is 1.647/23 = 0.072.

Now let's consider nodes 0 and 7. The shortest path distance between them is 7.

In layout 1, the Euclidean distance between nodes 0 and 7 is approximately sqrt((0.36-0.24)^2 + (-0.61 - (-0.01))^2) = sqrt(0.12^2 + (-0.6)^2) = sqrt(0.0144 + 0.36) = sqrt(0.3744) = 0.612. The ratio is 0.612/7 = 0.087.

In layout 2, the Euclidean distance between nodes 0 and 7 is approximately sqrt((-0.73 - (-0.02))^2 + (0.82 - (-0.99))^2) = sqrt((-0.71)^2 + (1.81)^2) = sqrt(0.5041 + 3.2761) = sqrt(3.7802) = 1.944. The ratio is 1.944/7 = 0.278.

Comparing the ratios, layout 1 has ratios of 0.030 and 0.087, while layout 2 has ratios of 0.072 and 0.278. The ratios in layout 1 are more consistent.
