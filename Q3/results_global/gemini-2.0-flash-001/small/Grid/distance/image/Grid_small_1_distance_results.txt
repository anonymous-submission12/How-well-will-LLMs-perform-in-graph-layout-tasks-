Based on the visual information provided, it's difficult to definitively say which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance without knowing the true graph structure. However, here's a qualitative assessment:

Layout 1 (the first image) appears to have more local clusters and connections that might reflect shorter graph distances between nearby nodes. However, it also has more overlapping edges, which can make it harder to visually estimate distances.

Layout 2 (the second image) seems to stretch the graph into a more linear or curved structure. This might distort graph distances, especially for nodes that are far apart in the layout but potentially close in the graph.

Without more information, it's hard to be certain. However, based on the general principle that layouts should try to keep nodes that are close in the graph close in the layout, Layout 1 seems slightly more likely to preserve graph-theoretic distance better.
