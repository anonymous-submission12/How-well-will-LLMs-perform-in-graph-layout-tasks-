Based on the visual representation of the two graph layouts, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 2, the nodes are arranged in a more structured grid-like manner, which suggests that the Euclidean distance between nodes is more closely related to the shortest path distance between them in the graph. Layout 1, on the other hand, has a more random arrangement, making it difficult to infer graph-theoretic distance from the Euclidean distance between nodes.
