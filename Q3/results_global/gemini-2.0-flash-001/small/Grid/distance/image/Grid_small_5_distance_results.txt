Layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, many edges cross and the overall structure is less clear, making it difficult to visually estimate the shortest path between nodes. Layout 2, with its grid-like structure, makes it much easier to see the connections and estimate the number of hops between nodes.
