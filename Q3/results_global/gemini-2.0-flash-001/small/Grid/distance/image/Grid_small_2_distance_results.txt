Layout 2 appears to be a grid-like structure, which generally preserves graph-theoretic distance better than the more tangled layout 1. In layout 1, it's difficult to visually estimate the shortest path between nodes, as many edges cross and the spatial arrangement doesn't clearly reflect the underlying graph structure. Layout 2, with its regular grid, makes it easier to approximate the number of hops between nodes.
