Without executing a crossing counting algorithm, it's difficult to definitively say which layout has fewer crossings. However, based on a visual assessment of the node coordinates, the second layout appears to be organized in a more radial fashion, which often leads to fewer crossings than a more tangled layout. Therefore, I will predict that layout 2 has fewer crossings.
