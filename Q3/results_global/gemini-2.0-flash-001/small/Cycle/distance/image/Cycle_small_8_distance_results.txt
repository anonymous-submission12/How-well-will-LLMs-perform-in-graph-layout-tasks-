The second layout (Answer 2) appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In the first layout, nodes that are close in the graph (i.e., connected by a small number of edges) can be far apart in the layout, and vice versa. The second layout arranges the nodes in a more circular fashion, which is more likely to reflect the actual distances between nodes in the graph.
