Based on the layouts provided, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, nodes that are close in the graph are placed far apart in the layout, and vice versa. Layout 2 arranges the nodes in a more sequential manner, which is more likely to reflect the actual distances between nodes in the graph.
