The graph in the second image is a cycle graph. In a cycle graph, the graph-theoretic distance between two nodes is the number of edges in the shortest path between them along the cycle. The second layout visually represents this structure well, as the nodes are arranged in a circular fashion, and the Euclidean distance between nodes along the cycle roughly corresponds to their graph-theoretic distance.

The first layout, on the other hand, has many crossings and does not clearly represent the underlying graph structure. The Euclidean distance between nodes in the first layout is unlikely to be a good approximation of their graph-theoretic distance.

Therefore, the second layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
