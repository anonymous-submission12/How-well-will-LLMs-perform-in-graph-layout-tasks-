Based on the visual representation of the two graph layouts, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, the nodes are arranged in a more tangled and less structured manner, making it difficult to visually estimate the shortest path between nodes. In contrast, layout 2 presents a more organized and circular arrangement, which allows for a clearer understanding of the relative distances between nodes based on their positions along the circle.
