Based on the visual representation of the two graph layouts, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, many nodes are clustered together, making it difficult to discern the actual path lengths between nodes in the graph. Layout 2, on the other hand, spreads the nodes out more evenly, making it easier to visually estimate the distance between nodes based on their positions in the layout.
