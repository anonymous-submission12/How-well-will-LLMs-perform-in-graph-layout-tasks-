Based on the visual representation of the graph layouts, Layout 2 appears to better preserve the graph-theoretic distance. In Layout 1, nodes that are far apart in the graph (e.g., node 0 and node 27) are placed relatively close to each other in the layout, and the path from 0 to 28 is not direct. Layout 2 arranges the nodes in a more linear fashion, reflecting the path structure of the graph more accurately.
