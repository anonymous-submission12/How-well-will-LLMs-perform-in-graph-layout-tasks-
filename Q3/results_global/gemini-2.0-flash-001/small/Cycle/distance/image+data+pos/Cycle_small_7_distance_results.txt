Layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, nodes that are far apart in the graph (e.g., node 7 and node 21) are placed relatively close to each other in the layout. In layout 2, the nodes are arranged in a more linear fashion, which more closely reflects the path structure of the graph.
