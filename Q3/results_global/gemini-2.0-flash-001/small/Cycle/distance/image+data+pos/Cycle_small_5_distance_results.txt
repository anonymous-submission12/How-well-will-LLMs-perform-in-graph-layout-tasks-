Based on the visual representation and the graph data, layout 2 appears to better preserve the graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, there are many edge crossings and nodes are clustered together in a way that doesn't reflect the path-like structure of the graph. Layout 2, on the other hand, arranges the nodes in a more linear fashion, which aligns with the graph's structure as a path.
