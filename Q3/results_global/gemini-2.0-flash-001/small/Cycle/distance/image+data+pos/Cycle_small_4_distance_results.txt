Based on the visual representation of the graph layouts, layout 2 appears to better preserve the graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, there are many edge crossings and nodes are placed in a way that doesn't reflect the connections in the graph. Layout 2, on the other hand, arranges the nodes in a more linear fashion, which aligns with the graph structure (a path with one additional edge).
