Let's analyze how well each layout preserves graph-theoretic distances. The graph is a path from node 0 to node 22. We need to compare the graph distance between pairs of nodes with their Euclidean distance in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two distances.

Layout 1: The coordinates seem somewhat scattered.
Layout 2: The coordinates appear to follow a more linear progression, which is more consistent with the path structure of the graph.

To make a more informed decision, we can consider a few specific node pairs and compare the ratio of their Euclidean distance to their graph distance in each layout. For example, consider nodes 0 and 22, which are connected by a path of length 23.

In Layout 1, the Euclidean distance between nodes 0 and 22 is sqrt((0.8-0.64)^2 + (0.54-0.23)^2) = sqrt(0.0256 + 0.0961) = sqrt(0.1217) = 0.349.
In Layout 2, the Euclidean distance between nodes 0 and 22 is sqrt((-0.26+0.04)^2 + (1.0-0.97)^2) = sqrt(0.0484 + 0.0009) = sqrt(0.0493) = 0.222.

Consider nodes 0 and 11, which are connected by a path of length 12.
In Layout 1, the Euclidean distance between nodes 0 and 11 is sqrt((0.8+0.11)^2 + (0.54+0.48)^2) = sqrt(0.8281 + 1.0404) = sqrt(1.8685) = 1.367.
In Layout 2, the Euclidean distance between nodes 0 and 11 is sqrt((-0.26-0.33)^2 + (1.0+0.95)^2) = sqrt(0.3481 + 3.8025) = sqrt(4.1506) = 2.037.

Based on the visual inspection and the example calculations, Layout 2 seems to better preserve the graph-theoretic distances. The nodes are arranged in a more linear fashion, which aligns with the path structure of the graph.
