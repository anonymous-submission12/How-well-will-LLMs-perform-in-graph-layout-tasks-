Let's analyze how well each layout preserves graph-theoretic distances. The graph is a path with an additional edge (0, 20). The graph-theoretic distance between two nodes is the number of edges in the shortest path between them. We want to compare these distances to the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that preserves graph-theoretic distances well will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph-theoretic distances.

Layout 1: The nodes are scattered somewhat randomly.
Layout 2: The nodes are laid out in a more linear fashion, which better reflects the path structure of the graph.

Consider the path from node 0 to node 19. The graph-theoretic distance is 20. In layout 1, the Euclidean distance between node 0 and node 19 appears relatively small compared to the path length. In layout 2, the Euclidean distance between node 0 and node 19 appears larger and more consistent with the path length.

Consider the edge (0, 20). In the graph, the distance between 0 and 20 is 1. In layout 1, the Euclidean distance between 0 and 20 is relatively large. In layout 2, the Euclidean distance between 0 and 20 is smaller.

Based on these observations, layout 2 seems to better preserve graph-theoretic distances.
