Let's analyze how well each layout preserves graph-theoretic distances. The graph is a path from node 0 to node 21. We need to compare the Euclidean distances between consecutive nodes in each layout with the graph distance (which is always 1 for adjacent nodes). A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have Euclidean distances between adjacent nodes that are more uniform and closer to a constant value.

Layout 1:  The coordinates seem scattered.
Layout 2: The coordinates appear to be laid out in a more linear fashion.

To make a more informed decision, we can calculate the average Euclidean distance between adjacent nodes for each layout.

Layout 1:
(0,1): 0.35
(0,21): 0.6
(1,2): 0.62
(2,3): 0.53
(3,4): 0.43
(4,5): 0.38
(5,6): 0.6
(6,7): 0.58
(7,8): 0.56
(8,9): 0.88
(9,10): 0.16
(10,11): 0.2
(11,12): 0.62
(12,13): 0.51
(13,14): 0.43
(14,15): 0.27
(15,16): 0.07
(16,17): 0.66
(17,18): 0.57
(18,19): 0.34
(19,20): 0.37
(20,21): 0.33

Average distance for layout 1 (excluding 0,21): 0.45

Layout 2:
(0,1): 0.28
(0,21): 0.2
(1,2): 0.22
(2,3): 0.2
(3,4): 0.2
(4,5): 0.17
(5,6): 0.21
(6,7): 0.2
(7,8): 0.2
(8,9): 0.24
(9,10): 0.25
(10,11): 0.26
(11,12): 0.26
(12,13): 0.3
(13,14): 0.24
(14,15): 0.18
(15,16): 0.17
(16,17): 0.17
(17,18): 0.16
(18,19): 0.17
(19,20): 0.16
(20,21): 0.24

Average distance for layout 2 (excluding 0,21): 0.21

Layout 2 has a more consistent distance between adjacent nodes, and the average distance is smaller, suggesting a better preservation of graph-theoretic distance.
