To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the original graph. The graph is a path from 0 to 26 with an additional edge between 0 and 26.

Layout 1: It seems to have some nodes close together that are far apart in the graph (e.g., 4 and 9).
Layout 2: This layout appears to be more linear, which is expected for a path graph.

Without performing extensive calculations, a visual inspection suggests that Layout 2 is better at preserving graph-theoretic distances. The nodes are arranged in a more linear fashion, reflecting the path structure of the graph. Layout 1 seems to have more distortions, with nodes that are far apart in the graph being placed closer together in the layout.
