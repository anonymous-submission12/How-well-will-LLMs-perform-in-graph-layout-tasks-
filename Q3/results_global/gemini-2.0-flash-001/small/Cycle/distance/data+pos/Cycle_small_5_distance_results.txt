The graph data represents a path from node 0 to node 24. The graph-theoretic distance between two nodes is the number of edges in the shortest path between them. In this case, since it's a path, the graph-theoretic distance between node i and node j is simply |i-j|. We want to compare how well the two layouts preserve these distances. A good layout will have Euclidean distances between nodes that are roughly proportional to their graph-theoretic distances.

Layout 2 appears to be a more faithful representation of the path structure. The nodes are arranged in a more linear fashion, which better reflects the underlying graph structure. Layout 1 has more nodes clustered together, which distorts the graph distances.
