To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances between those nodes in the original graph. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have Euclidean distances that more closely correlate with the shortest path distances.

Since calculating all shortest path distances and comparing them to Euclidean distances for all pairs of nodes is computationally intensive and not feasible in this setting, I will approximate by considering a few pairs of nodes and comparing the ratios of their Euclidean distances to their graph distances in both layouts.

Let's consider nodes 0 and 27, which are connected by an edge, so their graph distance is 1. Let's also consider nodes 0 and 10. The shortest path between 0 and 10 is 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10, so the graph distance is 11.

Layout 1:
- Distance(0, 27): sqrt((0.68-0.25)^2 + (0.18-(-0.16))^2) = sqrt(0.43^2 + 0.34^2) = sqrt(0.1849 + 0.1156) = sqrt(0.3005) = 0.548
- Distance(0, 10): sqrt((0.68-(-0.21))^2 + (0.18-(-0.74))^2) = sqrt(0.89^2 + 0.92^2) = sqrt(0.7921 + 0.8464) = sqrt(1.6385) = 1.28

Layout 2:
- Distance(0, 27): sqrt((0.65-0.49)^2 + (0.51-0.72)^2) = sqrt(0.16^2 + (-0.21)^2) = sqrt(0.0256 + 0.0441) = sqrt(0.0697) = 0.264
- Distance(0, 10): sqrt((0.65-(-0.43))^2 + (0.51-(-0.91))^2) = sqrt(1.08^2 + 1.42^2) = sqrt(1.1664 + 2.0164) = sqrt(3.1828) = 1.78

Now let's calculate the ratios:

Layout 1:
- Ratio(0, 27): 0.548 / 1 = 0.548
- Ratio(0, 10): 1.28 / 11 = 0.116

Layout 2:
- Ratio(0, 27): 0.264 / 1 = 0.264
- Ratio(0, 10): 1.78 / 11 = 0.162

To determine which layout is better, we want the ratios to be more consistent. The standard deviation of the ratios in Layout 1 is higher than in Layout 2.

Layout 1: stddev([0.548, 0.116]) = 0.305
Layout 2: stddev([0.264, 0.162]) = 0.072

Since Layout 2 has a lower standard deviation, it is more consistent and better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
