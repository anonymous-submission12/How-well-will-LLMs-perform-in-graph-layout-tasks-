Without executing a crossing counting algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, I can make an educated guess based on a visual assessment of the node coordinates. Layout 2 appears to arrange the nodes in a more circular or spiral fashion, which often leads to fewer crossings for chain-like graphs compared to the more scattered arrangement in Layout 1. Therefore, I will predict that Layout 2 has fewer crossings.
