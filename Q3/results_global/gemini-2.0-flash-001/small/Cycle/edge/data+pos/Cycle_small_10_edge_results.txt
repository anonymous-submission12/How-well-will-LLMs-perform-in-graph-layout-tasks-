Without executing a crossing counting algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, based on a visual assessment of the node positions, layout 2 appears to have a more organized structure, potentially leading to fewer crossings. Therefore, I will predict that layout 2 has fewer crossings.

"Answer": "2"
