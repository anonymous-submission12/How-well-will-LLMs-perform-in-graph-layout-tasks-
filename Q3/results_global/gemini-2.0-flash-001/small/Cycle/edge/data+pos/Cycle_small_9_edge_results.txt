Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, based on a visual assessment of the node coordinates, the first layout appears to have more nodes clustered in the center, which might lead to more edge crossings. The second layout seems to have a more spread-out arrangement. Therefore, I will predict that the second layout has fewer crossings.
