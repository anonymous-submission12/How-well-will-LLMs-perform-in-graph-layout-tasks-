The graph data represents a simple path graph. In an ideal layout that preserves graph-theoretic distance, the Euclidean distances between consecutive nodes should be roughly equal, and the nodes should lie approximately on a straight line. Let's qualitatively assess both layouts.

Layout 1: The coordinates appear scattered. The path is not laid out in a straight line, and the distances between consecutive nodes vary significantly.

Layout 2: The coordinates appear to be laid out in a more linear fashion. The distances between consecutive nodes seem more uniform compared to layout 1.

Therefore, layout 2 better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
