The graph data represents a simple path graph. In an ideal layout that perfectly preserves graph-theoretic distance, the nodes would be placed along a straight line with equal spacing.

Layout 1 appears to be a somewhat arbitrary arrangement of the nodes. Layout 2, however, appears to be a more linear arrangement, although not perfectly straight. Therefore, Layout 2 likely better preserves graph-theoretic distance.
