Let $G$ be the graph with edges given by the subgraph data. Let $d_G(u, v)$ denote the graph-theoretic distance between nodes $u$ and $v$ in $G$. Let $d_1(u, v)$ and $d_2(u, v)$ denote the Euclidean distance between the coordinates of nodes $u$ and $v$ in layout 1 and layout 2, respectively. We want to determine which layout better preserves the graph-theoretic distance.

We can compare the correlation between the graph-theoretic distances and the Euclidean distances in each layout. A higher correlation indicates better preservation of graph-theoretic distance.  However, a simpler approach is to consider the average difference between graph distance and euclidean distance.

Layout 1:
The nodes are scattered somewhat randomly.

Layout 2:
The nodes are laid out in a more linear fashion, which more closely resembles the structure of the graph (a path).

Intuitively, layout 2 should better preserve graph-theoretic distance because it arranges the nodes in a way that reflects the path structure of the graph.  Nodes that are far apart in the graph are also far apart in the layout.

To confirm this, we can consider a few pairs of nodes and compare the graph distance to the Euclidean distance in each layout.

For example, consider nodes 0 and 23. The graph distance is 23.
In layout 1, the Euclidean distance is approximately $\sqrt{(0.56 - (-0.3))^2 + (0.28 - (-1.0))^2} = \sqrt{0.86^2 + 1.28^2} = \sqrt{0.7396 + 1.6384} = \sqrt{2.378} \approx 1.54$.
In layout 2, the Euclidean distance is approximately $\sqrt{(0.45 - (-0.61))^2 + (0.92 - (-1.0))^2} = \sqrt{1.06^2 + 1.92^2} = \sqrt{1.1236 + 3.6864} = \sqrt{4.81} \approx 2.19$.

Consider nodes 0 and 1. The graph distance is 1.
In layout 1, the Euclidean distance is approximately $\sqrt{(0.56 - 0.6)^2 + (0.28 - (-0.11))^2} = \sqrt{(-0.04)^2 + (0.39)^2} = \sqrt{0.0016 + 0.1521} = \sqrt{0.1537} \approx 0.39$.
In layout 2, the Euclidean distance is approximately $\sqrt{(0.45 - 0.36)^2 + (0.92 - 0.85)^2} = \sqrt{(0.09)^2 + (0.07)^2} = \sqrt{0.0081 + 0.0049} = \sqrt{0.013} \approx 0.11$.

In general, layout 2 seems to better reflect the graph distances.
