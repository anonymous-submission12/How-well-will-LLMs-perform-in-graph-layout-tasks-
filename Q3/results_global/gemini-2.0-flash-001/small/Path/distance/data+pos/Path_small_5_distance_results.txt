Let's analyze how well each layout preserves graph-theoretic distances. The graph is a simple path. Ideally, a layout that preserves graph-theoretic distance would arrange the nodes in a line, with equal spacing between consecutive nodes.

Layout 1: The nodes are scattered in 2D space. The Euclidean distances between consecutive nodes are not uniform, and the overall shape deviates significantly from a straight line.

Layout 2: The nodes are arranged in a more linear fashion. The Euclidean distances between consecutive nodes appear more uniform compared to Layout 1. The overall layout resembles a slightly curved line.

Therefore, Layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distances.
