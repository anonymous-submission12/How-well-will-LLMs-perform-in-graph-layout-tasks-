The graph data represents a simple path graph. The ideal layout would be a straight line, preserving graph distances as Euclidean distances. Let's qualitatively assess the two layouts.

Layout 1: The coordinates appear scattered. The path is not well-preserved as a straight line.

Layout 2: The coordinates appear to form a more or less straight line. This layout seems to better preserve the graph distances.

Therefore, Layout 2 is better.
