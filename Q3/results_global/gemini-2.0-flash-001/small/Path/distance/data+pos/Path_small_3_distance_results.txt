The graph data represents a simple path. We want to determine which layout of the nodes better preserves the graph-theoretic distances. The graph-theoretic distance between two nodes is the number of edges in the shortest path between them. In this case, since it's a simple path, it's just the absolute difference in their indices.

Layout 1 appears to be a more scattered arrangement of the nodes, while layout 2 appears to be a more linear arrangement. Since the graph is a simple path, a linear layout would intuitively preserve graph distances better. Let's consider a few node pairs and compare the Euclidean distances in both layouts to their graph distances.

Nodes 0 and 22: Graph distance is 22.
Layout 1: Euclidean distance is approximately sqrt((0.11 - (-0.68))^2 + (-0.76 - 0.33)^2) = sqrt(0.79^2 + (-1.09)^2) = sqrt(0.6241 + 1.1881) = sqrt(1.8122) = 1.35
Layout 2: Euclidean distance is approximately sqrt((1.0 - (-0.55))^2 + (0.23 - (-0.78))^2) = sqrt(1.55^2 + 1.01^2) = sqrt(2.4025 + 1.0201) = sqrt(3.4226) = 1.85

Nodes 0 and 1: Graph distance is 1.
Layout 1: Euclidean distance is approximately sqrt((0.11 - 0.41)^2 + (-0.76 - (-1.0))^2) = sqrt((-0.3)^2 + (0.24)^2) = sqrt(0.09 + 0.0576) = sqrt(0.1476) = 0.38
Layout 2: Euclidean distance is approximately sqrt((1.0 - 0.9)^2 + (0.23 - 0.22)^2) = sqrt(0.1^2 + 0.01^2) = sqrt(0.01 + 0.0001) = sqrt(0.0101) = 0.1

Nodes 10 and 12: Graph distance is 2.
Layout 1: Euclidean distance is approximately sqrt((-0.27 - 0.58)^2 + (0.55 - 0.65)^2) = sqrt((-0.85)^2 + (-0.1)^2) = sqrt(0.7225 + 0.01) = sqrt(0.7325) = 0.86
Layout 2: Euclidean distance is approximately sqrt((-0.04 - 0.05)^2 + (0.25 - (-0.08))^2) = sqrt((-0.09)^2 + (0.33)^2) = sqrt(0.0081 + 0.1089) = sqrt(0.117) = 0.34

In general, layout 2 seems to preserve the ordering and distances better than layout 1.
