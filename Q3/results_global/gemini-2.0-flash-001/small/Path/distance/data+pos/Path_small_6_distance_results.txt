The graph is a simple path. We want to see which layout better preserves the graph-theoretic distances. The graph-theoretic distance between node i and j is simply |i-j|. We can compare this to the Euclidean distance between the coordinates of node i and j in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have Euclidean distances that are more correlated with the graph-theoretic distances.

Layout 1: The coordinates seem scattered.
Layout 2: The coordinates seem to follow a path-like structure.

Let's consider the distance between node 0 and node 25. The graph-theoretic distance is 25.

In layout 1, the Euclidean distance between node 0 and node 25 is sqrt((-0.38 - (-0.48))^2 + (0.62 - (-1.0))^2) = sqrt(0.01 + 2.6244) = sqrt(2.6344) = 1.623.
In layout 2, the Euclidean distance between node 0 and node 25 is sqrt((-0.17 - (-0.48))^2 + (-1.0 - 0.69)^2) = sqrt(0.0961 + 2.8561) = sqrt(2.9522) = 1.718.

Let's consider the distance between node 0 and node 1. The graph-theoretic distance is 1.
In layout 1, the Euclidean distance is sqrt((-0.38 - (-0.54))^2 + (0.62 - 0.85)^2) = sqrt(0.0256 + 0.0529) = sqrt(0.0785) = 0.280.
In layout 2, the Euclidean distance is sqrt((-0.17 - (-0.19))^2 + (-1.0 - (-0.86))^2) = sqrt(0.0004 + 0.0196) = sqrt(0.02) = 0.141.

Layout 2 appears to be a better layout. The nodes are arranged in a more linear fashion, which is consistent with the path graph structure.
