Based on the images, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, many nodes are clustered together, making it difficult to visually estimate the actual path length between them in the graph. Layout 2, on the other hand, spreads the nodes out more evenly, making the Euclidean distance between nodes a better approximation of the graph distance.
