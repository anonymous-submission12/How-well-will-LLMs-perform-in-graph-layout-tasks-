Based on the visual representation of the two graph layouts, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, the nodes are scattered more randomly, and the Euclidean distances between nodes do not consistently reflect the shortest path distances in the graph. Layout 2, on the other hand, arranges the nodes in a more linear or curved fashion, which tends to align the Euclidean distance with the graph distance.
