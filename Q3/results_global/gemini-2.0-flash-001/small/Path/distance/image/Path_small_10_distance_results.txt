Based on the visual representation of the two graph layouts, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, the edges are arranged in a way that makes it difficult to visually estimate the shortest path between nodes. The edges cross each other frequently, and the overall structure is quite tangled. In contrast, layout 2 presents a more organized structure, where the nodes are arranged in a smoother, more predictable manner. This makes it easier to visually estimate the shortest path between any two nodes.
