Based on the layouts provided, layout 1 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. Layout 2 seems to collapse the graph into a near-linear structure, which would significantly distort the actual distances between nodes in the original graph. Layout 1, while still having some distortions, maintains more of the relative distances and connections between nodes.
