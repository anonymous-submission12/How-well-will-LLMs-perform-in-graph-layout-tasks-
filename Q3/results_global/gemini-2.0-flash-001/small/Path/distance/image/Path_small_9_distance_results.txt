Based on visual inspection, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, nodes that are far apart in the graph seem to be placed close together in the layout, and vice versa. Layout 2 seems to arrange the nodes in a more linear fashion, which is more likely to reflect the actual distances between nodes in the graph.
