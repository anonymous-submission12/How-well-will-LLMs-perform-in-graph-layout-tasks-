Based on the layouts provided, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, the nodes are arranged in a more tangled and less structured manner, making it difficult to visually estimate the shortest path between nodes. Layout 2, on the other hand, arranges the nodes in a more linear and less cluttered fashion, which makes it easier to visually approximate the graph-theoretic distance between nodes.
