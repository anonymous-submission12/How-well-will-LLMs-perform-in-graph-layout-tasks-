Without executing a full crossing count algorithm, it's difficult to definitively say which layout has fewer crossings. However, based on a visual assessment of the node coordinates and edge list, the second layout appears to be a more linear and less tangled representation of the graph. The first layout has nodes scattered more randomly, which likely leads to more edge crossings.
