Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it's difficult to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, based on the node coordinates provided, I can make an educated guess.

Layout 2 appears to be a more linear arrangement of nodes, following a roughly straight path. Layout 1 seems to have nodes scattered more randomly. A linear arrangement generally results in fewer edge crossings. Therefore, I'll predict that Layout 2 has fewer crossings.
