Without executing a crossing counting algorithm, it's difficult to definitively say which layout has fewer crossings. However, based on a visual estimation of the node coordinates and edge connections, the second layout appears to be a more linear and organized representation of the graph. The first layout seems to have more nodes scattered around, which might lead to more edge crossings. Therefore, I'll predict that the second layout has fewer crossings.
