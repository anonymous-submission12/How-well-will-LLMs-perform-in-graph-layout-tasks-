Without executing a crossing counting algorithm, it's difficult to definitively say which layout has fewer crossings. However, based on a visual assessment of the node coordinates, layout 2 appears to be a more linear and ordered arrangement of the nodes, which generally leads to fewer edge crossings. Layout 1 seems to have nodes scattered more randomly.
