Let's analyze the two layouts.

Layout 1: The nodes are scattered somewhat randomly. It's likely there will be several edge crossings. For example, the edge (0, 1) might cross edges like (11, 12) or (13, 14).

Layout 2: The nodes are arranged in a more or less linear fashion. The edges will mostly follow this linear arrangement, so there should be very few crossings, if any.

Therefore, layout 2 should have fewer edge crossings.
