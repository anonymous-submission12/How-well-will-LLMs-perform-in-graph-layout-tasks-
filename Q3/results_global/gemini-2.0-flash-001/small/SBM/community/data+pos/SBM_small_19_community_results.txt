Based on the graph data and node coordinates provided for the two layouts, here's an assessment of which layout better preserves the community structure visually:

The graph has the following community structure:
Community 1: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Community 2: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Community 3: 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21
Community 4: 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28

Layout 1:
- Community 1 is relatively well-clustered in the upper right.
- Community 2 is somewhat clustered in the lower left.
- Community 3 is clustered in the bottom center.
- Community 4 is scattered.

Layout 2:
- Community 1 is clustered on the left.
- Community 2 is clustered in the center-left.
- Community 3 is clustered in the center-right.
- Community 4 is clustered in the upper-right.

Visually, Layout 2 appears to separate the communities more distinctly.
