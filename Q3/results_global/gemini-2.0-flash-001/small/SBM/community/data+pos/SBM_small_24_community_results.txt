Based on the graph data and node coordinates provided, it's difficult to definitively say which layout (1 or 2) keeps the community structure visually clearer *without actually visualizing them*. However, I can make some educated guesses based on the coordinates:

Layout 1 seems to have a more spread-out arrangement of nodes, potentially making it easier to distinguish clusters. Layout 2 appears more compact, which could make it harder to visually separate communities.

Therefore, my best guess is that Layout 1 is better.
