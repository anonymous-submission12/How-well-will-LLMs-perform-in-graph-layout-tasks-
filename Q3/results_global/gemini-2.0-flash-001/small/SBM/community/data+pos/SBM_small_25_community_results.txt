Based on the graph data provided, it's difficult to definitively say which layout (1 or 2) visually represents the community structure more clearly *without actually visualizing them*. However, I can make some educated guesses based on the node coordinates:

Layout 1:

*   Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 seem to form a cluster in the upper region.
*   Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 appear to form another cluster.
*   Nodes 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 seem to form a third cluster.
*   Node 1 is somewhat isolated.

Layout 2:

*   Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are clustered together.
*   Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 are clustered together.
*   Nodes 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 are clustered together.
*   Nodes 11 and 17 are somewhat isolated.

Without visualization, it's hard to be certain. However, based on the coordinates, Layout 1 seems to separate the clusters more distinctly.
