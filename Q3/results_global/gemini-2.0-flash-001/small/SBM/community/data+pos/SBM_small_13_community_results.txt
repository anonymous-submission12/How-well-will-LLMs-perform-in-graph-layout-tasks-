Based on the graph data and node coordinates provided, it's difficult to definitively say which layout (1 or 2) keeps the community structure visually clearer *without actually visualizing the layouts*. However, I can offer some observations that might help in making that determination *if* you were to visualize them:

*   **Layout 1:** Nodes 0-9 seem to form a cluster, as do nodes 10-19, and 20-29. The coordinates appear more spread out, potentially leading to less overlap and clearer visual separation *if* the community structure aligns with these groups.

*   **Layout 2:** Again, nodes 0-9, 10-19, and 20-29 seem to form clusters. The coordinates seem more squished together, especially in the negative x and y axes. This *could* lead to more visual clutter and overlap, making community detection harder.

Given these observations, and *assuming* the coordinates translate to a reasonable visual representation, **Layout 1 *might*** present a clearer community structure due to the more spread-out node placement.
