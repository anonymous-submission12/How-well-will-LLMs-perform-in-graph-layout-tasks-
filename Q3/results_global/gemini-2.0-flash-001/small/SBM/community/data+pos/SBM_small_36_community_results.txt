Based on the graph data and node coordinates provided, it's difficult to definitively say which layout (1 or 2) keeps the community structure visually clearer *without actually visualizing them*. However, I can make some educated guesses based on the coordinates:

Layout 1 seems to have a cluster of nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) grouped together in the bottom left. Another cluster (8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) is in the top left. And a third cluster (16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22) is in the middle.

Layout 2 also seems to have similar clusters, but the coordinates are different.

Without visualization, it's hard to tell which layout better separates the clusters and minimizes edge crossings within and between clusters.  A good layout will have nodes within the same community closer together and nodes from different communities further apart.

Because I cannot visualize the layouts, I will assume that layout 1 is better.
