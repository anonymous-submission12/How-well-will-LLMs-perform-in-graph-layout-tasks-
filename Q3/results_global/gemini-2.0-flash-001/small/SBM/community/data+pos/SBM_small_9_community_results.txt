Based on the graph data and node coordinates provided, it's difficult to definitively determine which layout (1 or 2) visually represents the community structure more clearly *without actually visualizing the layouts*. However, I can make some inferences based on the coordinates:

Layout 1 seems to have a slightly more spread-out arrangement of nodes, potentially allowing for better visual separation between communities. The coordinates in Layout 2 appear more clustered together in the x-y plane.

Given this, a slightly better separation of nodes might make community structure more apparent.
