Based on the graph data and node coordinates provided, it appears that the nodes 0-8 form a community, 9-17 form a community, and 18-25 form a community.

Layout 1 seems to position nodes 0-8 somewhat close together, but there's significant overlap and no clear separation from the other nodes. Nodes 9-17 are also somewhat clustered, but again, there's no clear visual separation. Nodes 18-25 are also somewhat clustered.

Layout 2 seems to do a better job of separating the three communities visually. Nodes 0-8 are clustered in the top left, 9-17 are clustered in the top right, and 18-25 are clustered in the bottom.

Therefore, Layout 2 keeps the community structure visually clearer.
