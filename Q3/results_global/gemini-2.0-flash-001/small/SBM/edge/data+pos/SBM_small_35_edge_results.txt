Without executing a full crossing count algorithm, it's difficult to definitively say which layout has fewer crossings. However, I can provide a reasoned estimate based on visual cues and general graph layout principles.

Layout 1 appears to have nodes more clustered together, especially in the central region. This often leads to more edge crossings. Layout 2 seems to have a more spread-out arrangement, which generally reduces crossings.

Therefore, my estimate is that Layout 2 has fewer crossings.
