Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer edge crossings. However, based on a visual assessment of the node coordinates, the first layout appears to have nodes more evenly distributed, which *might* lead to fewer crossings. The second layout seems to have some nodes clustered together, which could increase the likelihood of edge crossings.

Therefore, my *estimated* answer is:
