Without executing a crossing counting algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, I can make an educated guess based on the distribution of nodes.

Layout 1 appears to have nodes somewhat randomly scattered. Layout 2 seems to have nodes more clustered together, which might lead to fewer long edges and thus fewer crossings.

Therefore, I'll guess that Layout 2 has fewer crossings.
