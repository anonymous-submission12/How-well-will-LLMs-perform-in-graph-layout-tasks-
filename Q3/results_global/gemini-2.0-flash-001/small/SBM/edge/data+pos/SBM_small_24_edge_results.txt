Without the ability to visualize the layouts, it's impossible to definitively determine the number of edge crossings in each. I can only provide a guess. Layout 2 seems to have nodes more clustered together, especially nodes 6-11, and 18-22. This might lead to more edge crossings. Therefore, I'll guess that layout 1 has fewer crossings.
