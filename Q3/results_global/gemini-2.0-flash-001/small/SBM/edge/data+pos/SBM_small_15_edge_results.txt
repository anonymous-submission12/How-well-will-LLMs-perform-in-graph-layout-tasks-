Without executing a crossing count algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, I can provide a heuristic assessment based on node distribution. Layout 2 appears to have nodes more spread out, which generally leads to fewer edge crossings. Layout 1 seems more clustered, potentially increasing crossings.
