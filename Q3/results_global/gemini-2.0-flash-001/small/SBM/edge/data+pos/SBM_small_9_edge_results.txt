Without the ability to execute code and visually inspect the layouts, it's impossible to definitively determine the number of edge crossings in each layout. Estimating edge crossings by manually looking at coordinates is prone to error.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, I will make a guess. Layout 2 seems to have nodes more clustered together, which might lead to more edge crossings.
