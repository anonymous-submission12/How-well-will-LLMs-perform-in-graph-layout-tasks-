Without executing a crossing counting algorithm, it is difficult to definitively determine which layout has fewer crossings. However, I can make an educated guess based on the distribution of nodes.

Layout 1 appears to have nodes more clustered together, especially nodes 0-6. This clustering might lead to more edge crossings. Layout 2 seems to have a more spread-out distribution of nodes.

Therefore, my guess is that Layout 2 has fewer crossings.
