Without executing a crossing counting algorithm, it's impossible to definitively determine which layout has fewer edge crossings. However, I can provide a reasoned estimate based on visual inspection of the node coordinates.

Layout 1: Nodes seem more clustered, especially around the center. Edges connecting distant clusters (e.g., nodes 0-6 with 14-20, or 7-13 with 21-27) are likely to cause many crossings.

Layout 2: Nodes appear more spread out. While there are still clusters, the overall distribution seems to encourage fewer long, crossing edges.

Based on this qualitative assessment, I would estimate that Layout 2 has fewer crossings.
