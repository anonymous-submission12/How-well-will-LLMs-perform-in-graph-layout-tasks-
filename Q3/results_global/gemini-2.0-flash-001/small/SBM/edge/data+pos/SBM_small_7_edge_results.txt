Without the ability to visualize the layouts, it's impossible to definitively determine the number of edge crossings in each. I can only provide a guess based on general principles of graph layout. Layout 2 seems to have a more even distribution of nodes, which often leads to fewer crossings. However, this is just a heuristic.
