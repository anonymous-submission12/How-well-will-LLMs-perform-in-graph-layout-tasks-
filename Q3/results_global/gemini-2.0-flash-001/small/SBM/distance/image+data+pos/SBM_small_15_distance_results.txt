Based on visual inspection, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, the two clusters are very close together, which might suggest a shorter graph distance between nodes in different clusters than actually exists. Layout 2 separates the two clusters more distinctly, which is more consistent with the graph structure.
