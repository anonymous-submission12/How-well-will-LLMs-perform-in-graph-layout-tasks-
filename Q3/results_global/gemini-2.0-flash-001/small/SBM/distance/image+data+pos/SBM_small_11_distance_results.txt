Based on the visual representation of the graph layouts, Layout 1 appears to better preserve the graph-theoretic distance. In Layout 1, nodes that are far apart in the graph also tend to be far apart in the layout, and nodes that are close in the graph tend to be close in the layout. Layout 2 seems to compress some parts of the graph more than others, potentially distorting the graph-theoretic distances.
