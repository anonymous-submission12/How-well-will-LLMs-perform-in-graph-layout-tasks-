Based on the visual layouts, Layout 1 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In Layout 1, nodes that are close in the graph (i.e., connected by a short path) are also placed closer together in the layout. The clusters are more distinct and the relative distances between nodes within each cluster seem more consistent with the graph structure.
