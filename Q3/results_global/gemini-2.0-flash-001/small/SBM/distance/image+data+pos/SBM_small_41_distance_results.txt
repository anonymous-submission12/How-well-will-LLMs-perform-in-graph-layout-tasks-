Based on the visual representation of the layouts, layout 1 appears to better preserve the graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, nodes that are far apart in the graph are also generally far apart in the layout, and nodes that are close in the graph are also close in the layout. Layout 2 seems to cluster nodes together more tightly, potentially distorting the distances between nodes that are not directly connected.
