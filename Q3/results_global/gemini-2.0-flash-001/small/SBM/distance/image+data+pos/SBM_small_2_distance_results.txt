Based on visual inspection, layout 1 appears to better preserve the graph-theoretic distance. In layout 2, nodes that are far apart in the graph appear closer in the layout, and vice versa. For example, nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6 are clustered together in layout 1, which reflects their connectivity in the graph data. In layout 2, these nodes are also clustered, but the relative distances between them seem less consistent with the graph structure. Similarly, the cluster of nodes 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 is more clearly separated from the other nodes in layout 1, which aligns with the graph structure.
