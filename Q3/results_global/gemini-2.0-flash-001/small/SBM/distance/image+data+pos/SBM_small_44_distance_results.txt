Without performing computationally expensive graph distance calculations, it's difficult to give a definitive answer. However, I can make an educated guess based on visual inspection and general principles of graph layout.

Layout 1 appears to have more edge crossings and less clear separation of clusters compared to Layout 2. Layout 2 seems to group nodes that are highly connected closer together, and separates different clusters more distinctly. This suggests that Layout 2 might better reflect the underlying graph structure and thus preserve graph-theoretic distance better.
