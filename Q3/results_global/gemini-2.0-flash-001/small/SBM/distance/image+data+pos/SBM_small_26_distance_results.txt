To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the original graph. A good layout will place nodes that are close in the graph closer together in the layout.

Without performing extensive calculations, we can make some observations based on the provided data and layouts. Layout 1 seems to group nodes that are densely connected more closely together. For example, nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 form a highly interconnected cluster, and they appear relatively close together in Layout 1. Similarly, nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 form another cluster, and nodes 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 form a third cluster.

Layout 2 also attempts to group these clusters, but the relative positioning of nodes within each cluster and the distances between clusters appear less consistent with the graph structure. For instance, the cluster containing nodes 14-20 seems more spread out in Layout 2 compared to Layout 1.

Therefore, based on a visual assessment and considering the clustering of nodes, Layout 1 appears to better preserve the graph-theoretic distances.
