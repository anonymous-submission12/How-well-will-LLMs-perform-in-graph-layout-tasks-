Based on the visual representation of the graph layouts, layout 1 appears to better preserve the graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, nodes that are far apart in the graph (in terms of the number of edges between them) are also placed far apart in the layout. Layout 2 seems to compress some parts of the graph, making it harder to visually estimate graph distances.
