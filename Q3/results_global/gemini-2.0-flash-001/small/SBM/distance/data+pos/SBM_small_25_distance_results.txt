To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances between those nodes in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph distances. Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, I will use a heuristic approach. I will look for obvious distortions in each layout.

In layout 1, nodes connected in the graph appear to be relatively close to each other in the layout. There are no immediately obvious large distortions.

In layout 2, nodes connected in the graph also appear to be relatively close to each other. However, there are some potential distortions. For example, node 17 is connected to 6, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20. In layout 2, 17 is close to 18, 16, 14, 15, 19, 20, but 6 is relatively far away.

Without performing detailed calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, based on a visual inspection and considering the connectivity of the graph, layout 1 seems to have fewer obvious distortions compared to layout 2.
