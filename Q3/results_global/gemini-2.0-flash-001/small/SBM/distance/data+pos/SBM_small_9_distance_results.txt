To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two distance measures. Since a full calculation of all pairwise distances and their correlation is computationally intensive and not feasible in this setting, I will use a heuristic approach by comparing a few node pairs and their distances in both layouts.

Let's consider node pairs (0, 17) and (14, 26).

*   **Node pair (0, 17):**
    *   Graph distance: Shortest path between 0 and 17 is 0-6-17, so the graph distance is 2.
    *   Layout 1 Euclidean distance: sqrt((-0.89 - 0.09)^2 + (-0.37 - (-0.4))^2) = sqrt((-0.98)^2 + (0.03)^2) = sqrt(0.9604 + 0.0009) = sqrt(0.9613) = 0.98
    *   Layout 2 Euclidean distance: sqrt((0.34 - (-0.17))^2 + (-0.64 - 0.01)^2) = sqrt((0.51)^2 + (-0.65)^2) = sqrt(0.2601 + 0.4225) = sqrt(0.6826) = 0.83

*   **Node pair (14, 26):**
    *   Graph distance: Shortest path between 14 and 26 is 14-17-26, so the graph distance is 2.
    *   Layout 1 Euclidean distance: sqrt((0.43 - (-0.6))^2 + (-0.05 - 0.46)^2) = sqrt((1.03)^2 + (-0.51)^2) = sqrt(1.0609 + 0.2601) = sqrt(1.321) = 1.15
    *   Layout 2 Euclidean distance: sqrt((-0.46 - (-0.29))^2 + (-0.09 - 0.57)^2) = sqrt((-0.17)^2 + (-0.66)^2) = sqrt(0.0289 + 0.4356) = sqrt(0.4645) = 0.68

Without performing a full correlation analysis, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, based on these two node pairs, Layout 1 seems to have larger Euclidean distances corresponding to the graph distances. This might indicate a better preservation of the overall structure.
