To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two types of distances. Since calculating all pairwise distances and their correlations is computationally intensive and not feasible in this setting, I will approximate by visually inspecting the layouts and considering a few key aspects:

*   **Edge Length Consistency:** Ideally, edges in the graph should have relatively uniform lengths in the layout. Significant variations in edge lengths suggest distortion.
*   **Clustering:** Nodes that are close in the graph should also be close in the layout.
*   **Overall Structure:** The layout should reflect the overall structure of the graph (e.g., clusters, paths).

Without performing the full calculation, I will make a judgment based on visual assessment.

Layout 1 appears to have more uneven edge lengths and less clear clustering compared to Layout 2. Layout 2 seems to spread the nodes more evenly and maintain the relative proximity of connected nodes better.
