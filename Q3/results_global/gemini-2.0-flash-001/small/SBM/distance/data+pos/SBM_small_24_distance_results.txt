To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two distance measures. Since a full calculation of all pairwise distances and their correlation is computationally intensive and not feasible in this setting, I will make a qualitative assessment based on the node coordinates provided.

Layout 1 seems to have nodes that are directly connected placed closer together in the Euclidean space. For example, nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3, which form a dense subgraph, are positioned relatively close to each other. Similarly, nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, which also form a dense subgraph, are grouped together.

Layout 2 appears to have some distortions. For instance, nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 are clustered together in the upper part of the layout, while nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are clustered in the lower-left part. The distances between these two clusters might not accurately reflect their graph-theoretic distances. Also, nodes 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22 are clustered together, which might not reflect their actual graph distances to other nodes.

Based on this qualitative assessment, Layout 1 seems to better preserve the graph-theoretic distances compared to Layout 2.
