To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two types of distances. Since calculating all pairwise distances and their correlations is computationally intensive and beyond the scope of this interaction, I will use a simplified approach.

I will select a few node pairs and compare the ratio of their Euclidean distances in the two layouts to their graph distances. This will give a rough indication of which layout is better.

Consider nodes 0 and 1. They are directly connected, so their graph distance is 1.
Layout 1: Euclidean distance between 0 and 1 is sqrt((-0.26 - 0.01)^2 + (-0.17 - (-0.43))^2) = sqrt((-0.27)^2 + (0.26)^2) = sqrt(0.0729 + 0.0676) = sqrt(0.1405) = 0.3748
Layout 2: Euclidean distance between 0 and 1 is sqrt((0.11 - (-0.25))^2 + (0.2 - 0.41)^2) = sqrt((0.36)^2 + (-0.21)^2) = sqrt(0.1296 + 0.0441) = sqrt(0.1737) = 0.4168

Consider nodes 0 and 14.
Layout 1: Euclidean distance between 0 and 14 is sqrt((-0.26 - 0.52)^2 + (-0.17 - 0.2)^2) = sqrt((-0.78)^2 + (-0.37)^2) = sqrt(0.6084 + 0.1369) = sqrt(0.7453) = 0.8633
Layout 2: Euclidean distance between 0 and 14 is sqrt((0.11 - (-0.32))^2 + (0.2 - (-0.27))^2) = sqrt((0.43)^2 + (0.47)^2) = sqrt(0.1849 + 0.2209) = sqrt(0.4058) = 0.6370

Nodes 0 and 1 are adjacent in the graph. Nodes 0 and 14 are not adjacent, and a shortest path between them is 0-14. So the graph distance is 1.

It's difficult to make a definitive conclusion based on just these two pairs. However, let's consider another pair: 7 and 8. They are adjacent.
Layout 1: Euclidean distance between 7 and 8 is sqrt((-0.91 - (-0.01))^2 + (0.26 - 0.3)^2) = sqrt((-0.9)^2 + (-0.04)^2) = sqrt(0.81 + 0.0016) = sqrt(0.8116) = 0.9009
Layout 2: Euclidean distance between 7 and 8 is sqrt((0.81 - 1.0)^2 + (-0.3 - (-0.06))^2) = sqrt((-0.19)^2 + (-0.24)^2) = sqrt(0.0361 + 0.0576) = sqrt(0.0937) = 0.3061

Without performing a more thorough analysis, it's hard to say definitively. However, based on the limited comparisons, Layout 2 seems to have smaller Euclidean distances for adjacent nodes compared to Layout 1. This might indicate that Layout 2 is compressing the graph more, potentially distorting graph distances. Therefore, Layout 1 might be slightly better at preserving graph-theoretic distances.
