To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph distances.  Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, I will approximate by visually inspecting the layouts and considering a few key relationships.

Layout 1 seems to cluster nodes more tightly, potentially distorting graph distances. Layout 2 appears to spread the nodes out more, which might better reflect the graph structure. Without performing the full calculation, it's difficult to say definitively. However, based on the visual spread and the potential for better preservation of relative distances, I'll lean towards Layout 2.
