To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph distances.  Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, I will approximate by considering a few node pairs and visually inspecting the layouts.

Let's consider nodes 0 and 15. In the graph, they are not directly connected. The shortest path between them appears to be 0-3-1-15 or 0-3-2-15 or similar paths of length 3 or 4.

In layout 1, the coordinates of 0 and 15 are [0.01, -1.0] and [-0.16, 0.04] respectively. The Euclidean distance is approximately sqrt((-0.16-0.01)^2 + (0.04+1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.0289 + 1.0816) = sqrt(1.1105) = 1.05.

In layout 2, the coordinates of 0 and 15 are [-0.14, 0.38] and [-0.01, -0.38] respectively. The Euclidean distance is approximately sqrt((-0.01+0.14)^2 + (-0.38-0.38)^2) = sqrt(0.0169 + 0.5776) = sqrt(0.5945) = 0.77.

Let's consider nodes 12 and 23. They are directly connected.

In layout 1, the coordinates of 12 and 23 are [0.46, 0.93] and [0.12, 0.2] respectively. The Euclidean distance is approximately sqrt((0.12-0.46)^2 + (0.2-0.93)^2) = sqrt(0.1156 + 0.5329) = sqrt(0.6485) = 0.81.

In layout 2, the coordinates of 12 and 23 are [-0.0, -0.93] and [0.11, -0.43] respectively. The Euclidean distance is approximately sqrt((0.11-0.0)^2 + (-0.43+0.93)^2) = sqrt(0.0121 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.2621) = 0.51.

Without performing a full shortest path analysis, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, based on the limited examples, layout 2 seems to cluster nodes that are close in the graph closer together in the Euclidean space.
