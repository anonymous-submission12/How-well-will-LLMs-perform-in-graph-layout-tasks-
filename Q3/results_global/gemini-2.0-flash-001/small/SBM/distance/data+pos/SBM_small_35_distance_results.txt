To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph distances. Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, I will use a heuristic approach. I will look for obvious distortions in each layout.

In layout 1, nodes 9, 10, 12, and 14 are clustered together in the upper part of the layout, while nodes 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21 are clustered in the lower left. Nodes 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28 are also clustered together.

In layout 2, the nodes seem more spread out.

Without performing detailed calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, the more even distribution of nodes in layout 2 suggests that it might better preserve graph-theoretic distances compared to layout 1, where several groups of nodes are clustered together.
