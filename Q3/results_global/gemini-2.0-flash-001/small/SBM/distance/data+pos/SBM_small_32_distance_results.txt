To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two types of distances. Since a full quantitative comparison is not feasible without code execution, I will make a qualitative assessment based on the node positions in each layout.

Layout 1:
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 form a dense cluster, which aligns with the graph structure.
- Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 also form a dense cluster.
- Nodes 12, 13, 15, 16 are clustered.
- Nodes 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21 are clustered.
- Nodes 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26 are clustered.

Layout 2:
- The layout seems more spread out.
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 are relatively close.
- Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are close.
- Nodes 12, 13, 15, 16 are close.
- Nodes 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21 are close.
- Nodes 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26 are close.

Based on a visual assessment, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, Layout 1 seems to group the nodes more tightly according to the subgraphs, which might indicate a better preservation of graph-theoretic distance.
