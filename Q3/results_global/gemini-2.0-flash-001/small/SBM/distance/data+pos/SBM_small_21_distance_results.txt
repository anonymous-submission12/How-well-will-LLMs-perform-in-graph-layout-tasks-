To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph distances. Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, we can approximate this by comparing a few node pairs.

Let's consider a few node pairs and their graph distances:
- Nodes 0 and 1: Graph distance = 1
- Nodes 0 and 7: Graph distance = 3
- Nodes 10 and 19: Graph distance = 4
- Nodes 20 and 29: Graph distance = 1

Now, let's calculate the Euclidean distances for these node pairs in both layouts:

Layout 1:
- Nodes 0 and 1: sqrt((-0.36 - (-0.57))^2 + (0.67 - 0.66)^2) = sqrt(0.0441 + 0.0001) = 0.21
- Nodes 0 and 7: sqrt((-0.36 - (-0.15))^2 + (0.67 - 0.3)^2) = sqrt(0.0441 + 0.1369) = 0.42
- Nodes 10 and 19: sqrt((-0.03 - (-0.48))^2 + (-0.5 - (-1.0))^2) = sqrt(0.2025 + 0.25) = 0.67
- Nodes 20 and 29: sqrt((0.67 - 0.16)^2 + (0.24 - 0.07)^2) = sqrt(0.2601 + 0.0289) = 0.54

Layout 2:
- Nodes 0 and 1: sqrt((-0.6 - (-0.8))^2 + (0.25 - 0.57)^2) = sqrt(0.04 + 0.1024) = 0.38
- Nodes 0 and 7: sqrt((-0.6 - (-0.73))^2 + (0.25 - 0.62)^2) = sqrt(0.0169 + 0.1369) = 0.39
- Nodes 10 and 19: sqrt((0.64 - 1.0)^2 + (-0.14 - 0.17)^2) = sqrt(0.1296 + 0.0961) = 0.48
- Nodes 20 and 29: sqrt((-0.26 - (-0.13))^2 + (-0.49 - (-0.36))^2) = sqrt(0.0169 + 0.0169) = 0.18

Comparing the ratios of Euclidean distances to graph distances, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better based on just these few examples. However, let's consider the relative distances. In Layout 1, the distance between 0 and 7 is larger than the distance between 0 and 1, which aligns with the graph distances. Similarly, in Layout 2, the distance between 0 and 7 is larger than the distance between 0 and 1.

Without more rigorous calculations, it's hard to give a definitive answer. However, based on the limited analysis, Layout 2 seems to have a slightly better preservation of relative distances for the chosen node pairs.
