To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances in the original graph. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have Euclidean distances that more closely reflect the shortest path distances.  Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, I will approximate by visually inspecting the layouts and considering a few key relationships.

Layout 1: Nodes seem more spread out, potentially leading to a better representation of graph distances. There's a clearer separation between different parts of the graph.

Layout 2: Nodes appear more clustered together, which might compress distances and make it harder to distinguish between nodes that are far apart in the graph.

Based on this qualitative assessment, Layout 1 seems more likely to preserve graph-theoretic distances better.
