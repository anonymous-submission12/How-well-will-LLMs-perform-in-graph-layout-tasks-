To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances between those nodes in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph distances. Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, I will estimate by visually inspecting the layouts and considering a few key node pairs and their connections in the graph.

Layout 1:
Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5 are clustered together, which aligns with the graph structure. Node 27 is somewhat separated from this cluster. Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 form another cluster. Nodes 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 form another cluster. Nodes 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 form another cluster. Nodes 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 form another cluster.

Layout 2:
Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5 are clustered together, which aligns with the graph structure. Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 form another cluster. Nodes 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 form another cluster. Nodes 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 form another cluster. Nodes 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 form another cluster.

Comparing the two layouts, it's difficult to definitively say which one is better without more rigorous calculations. However, based on visual inspection, Layout 1 seems to have a slightly better arrangement of nodes relative to their connections in the graph. For example, the cluster of nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5 seems more compact in Layout 1, which might better reflect their close relationships in the graph.
