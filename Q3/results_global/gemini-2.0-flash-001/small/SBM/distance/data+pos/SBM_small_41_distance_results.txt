The problem asks us to determine which of the two given layouts better preserves the graph-theoretic distance. This means we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances between those nodes in the graph. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have Euclidean distances that more closely reflect the shortest path distances.

Since a full quantitative comparison would be computationally intensive, we can use a qualitative approach by examining some key relationships and looking for obvious distortions in each layout.

Let's consider layout 1. Node 0 is connected to 1, 2, and 3. The coordinates are:
0: [0.42, 0.6]
1: [0.73, 0.45]
2: [0.27, 0.5]
3: [-0.05, 0.62]

These nodes are relatively close to each other in the layout, which is consistent with their direct connections.

Now let's consider layout 2. Node 0 is connected to 1, 2, and 3. The coordinates are:
0: [0.17, 0.26]
1: [0.05, 0.14]
2: [0.02, 0.38]
3: [0.28, 0.33]

These nodes are also relatively close to each other in the layout, which is consistent with their direct connections.

Let's consider nodes 6, 8, 10, 11, 7. They form a connected component.
In layout 1:
6: [-0.07, -0.12]
8: [0.06, -0.39]
10: [0.42, -0.16]
11: [0.23, -0.53]
7: [0.29, -0.08]
These nodes are relatively close to each other.

In layout 2:
6: [-0.14, -0.42]
8: [0.01, -0.44]
10: [-0.06, -0.35]
11: [-0.15, -0.28]
7: [-0.03, -0.29]
These nodes are also relatively close to each other.

Let's consider nodes 18, 19, 20, 22. They form a connected component.
In layout 1:
18: [-1.0, -0.02]
19: [-0.85, -0.25]
20: [-0.52, -0.23]
22: [-0.82, -0.03]
These nodes are relatively close to each other.

In layout 2:
18: [0.21, -0.8]
19: [0.14, -0.86]
20: [0.13, -0.7]
22: [0.25, -0.88]
These nodes are also relatively close to each other.

Without performing more detailed calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, based on the general proximity of connected nodes, layout 1 seems to have less distortion.
