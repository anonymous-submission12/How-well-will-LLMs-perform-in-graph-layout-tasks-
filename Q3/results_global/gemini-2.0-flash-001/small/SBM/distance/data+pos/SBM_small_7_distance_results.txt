To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare the graph distances with the Euclidean distances in each layout. A layout that better preserves graph-theoretic distance will have a stronger correlation between these two distance measures. Since calculating all pairwise distances and their correlation is computationally intensive and beyond the scope of this response, I will use a heuristic approach based on visual inspection and a few example comparisons.

Layout 1: Nodes that are close in the graph (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) are relatively close in the layout. Similarly, nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 are grouped together. Nodes 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 are also grouped. This suggests a reasonable preservation of graph structure.

Layout 2: Similar to layout 1, nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are grouped. Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 are grouped. Nodes 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 are also grouped.

Without performing detailed calculations, it's difficult to definitively say which layout is better. However, based on visual inspection, Layout 2 seems to have a slightly better arrangement where nodes connected in the graph are also closer in the Euclidean space compared to Layout 1.
