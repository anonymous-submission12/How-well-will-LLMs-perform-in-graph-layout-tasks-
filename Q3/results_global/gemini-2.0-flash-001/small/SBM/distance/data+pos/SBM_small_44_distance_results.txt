To determine which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance, we need to compare how well the Euclidean distances between nodes in each layout correspond to the shortest path distances between those nodes in the original graph. A good layout will have Euclidean distances that are roughly proportional to the graph distances.  Since calculating all shortest paths and comparing them to Euclidean distances is computationally intensive, I will estimate by considering a few node pairs and their distances in both layouts.

Let's consider nodes 0 and 1. They are directly connected, so their graph distance is 1.
In layout 1, the Euclidean distance between 0 and 1 is sqrt((0.63-0.35)^2 + (-0.03-0.23)^2) = sqrt(0.28^2 + (-0.26)^2) = sqrt(0.0784 + 0.0676) = sqrt(0.146) = 0.382
In layout 2, the Euclidean distance between 0 and 1 is sqrt((0.3-0.46)^2 + (0.12-0.21)^2) = sqrt((-0.16)^2 + (-0.09)^2) = sqrt(0.0256 + 0.0081) = sqrt(0.0337) = 0.184

Let's consider nodes 0 and 13. The shortest path is 0-2-13, so their graph distance is 2.
In layout 1, the Euclidean distance between 0 and 13 is sqrt((0.63-0.05)^2 + (-0.03-(-0.15))^2) = sqrt(0.58^2 + 0.12^2) = sqrt(0.3364 + 0.0144) = sqrt(0.3508) = 0.592
In layout 2, the Euclidean distance between 0 and 13 is sqrt((0.3-0.27)^2 + (0.12-(-0.08))^2) = sqrt(0.03^2 + 0.2^2) = sqrt(0.0009 + 0.04) = sqrt(0.0409) = 0.202

Let's consider nodes 22 and 26. They are directly connected, so their graph distance is 1.
In layout 1, the Euclidean distance between 22 and 26 is sqrt((-0.39-(-0.52))^2 + (0.69-1.0)^2) = sqrt(0.13^2 + (-0.31)^2) = sqrt(0.0169 + 0.0961) = sqrt(0.113) = 0.336
In layout 2, the Euclidean distance between 22 and 26 is sqrt((-0.76-(-1.0))^2 + (-0.24-(-0.28))^2) = sqrt(0.24^2 + 0.04^2) = sqrt(0.0576 + 0.0016) = sqrt(0.0592) = 0.243

It's difficult to definitively say which is better without more rigorous calculations. However, based on these few examples, layout 1 seems to have Euclidean distances that are more proportionally related to the graph distances.
