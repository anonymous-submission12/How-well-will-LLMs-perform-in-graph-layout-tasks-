Both layouts seem to represent the same graph. It's difficult to definitively say which better preserves graph-theoretic distance without more rigorous analysis (e.g., comparing shortest path lengths in the graph to Euclidean distances in the layouts). However, visually, the first layout seems to spread the clusters out more evenly, which might give a slightly better representation of the distances between nodes in different clusters.
