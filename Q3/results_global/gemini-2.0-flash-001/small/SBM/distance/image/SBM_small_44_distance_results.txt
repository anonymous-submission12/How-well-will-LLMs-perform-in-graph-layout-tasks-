Based on visual inspection, it's difficult to definitively say which layout better preserves graph-theoretic distance without quantitative analysis. However, I can make an educated guess.

Layout 2 seems to group nodes that are likely closer in graph distance more tightly together. The clusters are more distinct. In layout 1, the nodes are more spread out, and it's harder to visually assess the graph distance between nodes.

Therefore, I'll guess that layout 2 is better.
