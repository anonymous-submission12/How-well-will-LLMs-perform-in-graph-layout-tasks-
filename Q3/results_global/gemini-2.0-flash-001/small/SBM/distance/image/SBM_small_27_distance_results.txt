Based on visual inspection, Layout 1 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. The clusters are more clearly defined and the relative distances between nodes within and between clusters seem more consistent with a graph representation. Layout 2 seems to stretch some connections and compress others, potentially distorting the actual graph distances.
