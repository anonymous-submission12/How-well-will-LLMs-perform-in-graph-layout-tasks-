Based on the layouts provided, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, the two clusters are positioned very close together, which might visually suggest shorter distances between nodes in different clusters than actually exist in the graph. Layout 2 spreads the clusters further apart, making the visual distances more representative of the actual graph distances.
