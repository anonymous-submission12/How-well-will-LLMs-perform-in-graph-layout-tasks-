Both layouts seem to represent the same graph, but the first layout (image 1) appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In the first layout, nodes that are far apart in the graph are also generally far apart in the layout, and nodes that are close in the graph are close in the layout. The second layout (image 2) seems to compress the graph more, making it harder to visually estimate graph distances.
