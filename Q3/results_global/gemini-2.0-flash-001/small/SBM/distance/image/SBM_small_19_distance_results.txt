Based on the visual representation of the two graph layouts, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 2, nodes that are far apart in the graph are also placed far apart in the layout, and nodes that are close in the graph are placed close together in the layout. This is not as evident in layout 1, where some nodes that appear to be far apart in the graph are placed closer together in the layout.
