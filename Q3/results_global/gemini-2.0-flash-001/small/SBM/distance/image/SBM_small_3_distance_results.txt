Both layouts appear to represent the same graph. Layout 1 seems to spread the nodes within each cluster more evenly, potentially making it easier to visually estimate distances between nodes within a cluster. Layout 2 compresses the clusters more. Therefore, layout 1 might be slightly better at preserving graph-theoretic distance.
