Based on visual inspection, Layout 1 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. The clusters of nodes seem more tightly packed in Layout 1, reflecting shorter path lengths within those clusters. Layout 2 seems to stretch out the graph more, potentially distorting the actual distances between nodes in the graph.
