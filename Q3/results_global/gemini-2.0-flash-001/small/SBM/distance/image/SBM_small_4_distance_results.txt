Based on the visual representation of the two graph layouts, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, the clusters are positioned closer together, potentially misleadingly suggesting shorter graph distances between nodes in different clusters. Layout 2 spreads the clusters out more, making the path lengths between clusters more visually representative of the actual graph distances.
