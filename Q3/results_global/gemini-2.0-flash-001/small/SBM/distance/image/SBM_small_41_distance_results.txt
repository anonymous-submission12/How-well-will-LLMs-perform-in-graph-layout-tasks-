Based on the layouts provided, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 2, nodes that are close in the graph (i.e., connected by a small number of edges) are also placed close to each other in the layout. This is evident in the clustered structure of the graph. In contrast, layout 1 seems to have nodes that are far apart in the graph placed close together in the layout, and vice versa.
