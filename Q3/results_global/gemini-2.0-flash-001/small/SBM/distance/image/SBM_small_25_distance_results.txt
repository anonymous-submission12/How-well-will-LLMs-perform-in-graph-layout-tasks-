Based on the visual representation of the graph layouts, it appears that the second layout (Layout 2) better preserves graph-theoretic distance. In Layout 2, nodes that are close in the graph structure are also placed closer together in the layout. The clusters are more clearly defined and the connections between them are more visually representative of the actual graph distances.
