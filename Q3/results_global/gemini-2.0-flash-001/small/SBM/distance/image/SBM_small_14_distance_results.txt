Based on the visual representation of the two graph layouts, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 2, nodes that are far apart in the graph also appear far apart in the layout, and nodes that are close in the graph appear close in the layout. Layout 1 seems to have more overlapping edges and nodes clustered together, making it harder to visually estimate graph distances.
