Based on the visual representation of the graph layouts, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 2, nodes that are far apart in the graph are also placed far apart in the layout, and nodes that are close in the graph are placed close in the layout. Layout 1 seems to compress the graph more, potentially distorting the relative distances between nodes.
