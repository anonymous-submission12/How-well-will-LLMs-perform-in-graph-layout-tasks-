Based on visual inspection, layout 2 appears to better preserve graph-theoretic distance. In layout 1, nodes that are far apart in the graph seem to be placed closer together in the layout, and vice versa. Layout 2 seems to arrange the nodes in a way that more closely reflects their connectivity and distance within the graph.
