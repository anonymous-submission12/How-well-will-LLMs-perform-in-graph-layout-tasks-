Let's analyze the given subgraph data and node coordinates to determine the relationship between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance between nodes 25 and 1.

The subgraph data represents the edges in the graph. The path from node 25 to node 1 is: 25 -> 24 -> 23 -> 22 -> 21 -> 20 -> 19 -> 18 -> 17 -> 16 -> 1.  The graph-theoretic distance is the number of edges in the shortest path between the two nodes. In this case, the path is explicitly given, and the graph-theoretic distance between node 25 and node 1 is 10.

Now, let's calculate the Euclidean distance between node 25 and node 1 using their coordinates:
Node 25: (-0.33, -0.04)
Node 1: (0.56, -0.26)

Euclidean distance = sqrt((0.56 - (-0.33))^2 + (-0.26 - (-0.04))^2)
= sqrt((0.56 + 0.33)^2 + (-0.26 + 0.04)^2)
= sqrt((0.89)^2 + (-0.22)^2)
= sqrt(0.7921 + 0.0484)
= sqrt(0.8405)
â‰ˆ 0.9168

The Euclidean distance between node 25 and node 1 is approximately 0.9168. The graph-theoretic distance is 10.

Since 0.9168 < 10, the Euclidean distance is less than the graph-theoretic distance.
