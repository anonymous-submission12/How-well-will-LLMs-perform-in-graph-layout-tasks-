Let's analyze the given subgraph data and node coordinates to determine the relationship between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance between nodes 57 and 20.

The subgraph data represents a path from node 20 to node 57. The path is: 20-21-22-23-24-25-26-27-28-29-30-31-32-33-34-35-36-37-38-39-40-41-42-43-44-45-46-47-48-49-50-51-52-53-54-55-56-57.

The graph-theoretic distance is the number of edges in the shortest path between two nodes. In this case, the graph-theoretic distance between node 57 and node 20 is the number of edges in the path from 20 to 57, which is 37.

Now, let's calculate the Euclidean distance between node 57 and node 20 using their coordinates:
Node 57: (-0.61, 0.7)
Node 20: (0.65, 0.18)

Euclidean distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
= sqrt((0.65 - (-0.61))^2 + (0.18 - 0.7)^2)
= sqrt((1.26)^2 + (-0.52)^2)
= sqrt(1.5876 + 0.2704)
= sqrt(1.858)
â‰ˆ 1.363

The Euclidean distance between node 57 and node 20 is approximately 1.363. The graph-theoretic distance is 37.

Since 1.363 < 37, the Euclidean distance is less than the graph-theoretic distance.
