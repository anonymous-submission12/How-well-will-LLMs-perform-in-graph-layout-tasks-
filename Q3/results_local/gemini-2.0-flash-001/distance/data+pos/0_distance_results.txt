Let's analyze the given subgraph data and node coordinates to determine the relationship between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance between nodes 5 and 14.

The subgraph data represents the edges in the graph. The path from node 5 to node 14 is: 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14. The graph-theoretic distance is the number of edges in the shortest path between two nodes. In this case, the graph-theoretic distance between node 5 and node 14 is 9.

Now, let's calculate the Euclidean distance between node 5 and node 14 using their coordinates:
Node 5: (0.58, -0.24)
Node 14: (-0.13, 0.67)

Euclidean distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
= sqrt((-0.13 - 0.58)^2 + (0.67 - (-0.24))^2)
= sqrt((-0.71)^2 + (0.91)^2)
= sqrt(0.5041 + 0.8281)
= sqrt(1.3322)
â‰ˆ 1.154

The Euclidean distance between node 5 and node 14 is approximately 1.154. The graph-theoretic distance is 9. Since 1.154 < 9, the Euclidean distance is less than the graph-theoretic distance.
