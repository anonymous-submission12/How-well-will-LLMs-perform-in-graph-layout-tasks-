Here's an analysis of the consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance for the given subgraph, source node 62, and target node 24:

**1. Graph-Theoretic Distance:**

*   We need to find the shortest path between node 62 and node 24 in the graph defined by the `subgraph_data`.
*   The edges are: (12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (37, 12), (37, 62)
*   A possible path is: 62 -> 37 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16 -> 17 -> 18 -> 19 -> 20 -> 21 -> 22 -> 23 -> 24.
*   The graph-theoretic distance is the number of edges in this shortest path. In this case, the distance is 15.

**2. Euclidean Distance:**

*   We need to calculate the straight-line distance between the coordinates of node 62 and node 24.
*   Node 62: [0.67, 0.26]
*   Node 24: [-0.84, 0.94]
*   Euclidean distance = sqrt((0.67 - (-0.84))^2 + (0.26 - 0.94)^2) = sqrt((1.51)^2 + (-0.68)^2) = sqrt(2.2801 + 0.4624) = sqrt(2.7425) ≈ 1.66

**3. Comparison:**

*   Graph-theoretic distance: 15
*   Euclidean distance: ≈ 1.66

Since 1.66 < 15, the Euclidean distance is less than the graph-theoretic distance.
