Here's an analysis of the consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance for the given subgraph, source node 22, and target node 9:

**1. Graph-Theoretic Distance:**

*   The subgraph edges are: (1, 8), (1, 19), (8, 9), (19, 22)
*   We need to find the shortest path from node 22 to node 9.
*   Path: 22 -> 19 -> 1 -> 8 -> 9. This path has a length of 4.
*   Therefore, the graph-theoretic distance between 22 and 9 is 4.

**2. Euclidean Distance:**

*   Node 22 coordinates: [-0.53, -0.55]
*   Node 9 coordinates: [0.82, 0.53]
*   Euclidean distance = sqrt((0.82 - (-0.53))^2 + (0.53 - (-0.55))^2)
*   Euclidean distance = sqrt((1.35)^2 + (1.08)^2)
*   Euclidean distance = sqrt(1.8225 + 1.1664)
*   Euclidean distance = sqrt(2.9889) ≈ 1.73

**3. Comparison:**

*   Euclidean distance ≈ 1.73
*   Graph-theoretic distance = 4

Since 1.73 < 4, the Euclidean distance is less than the graph-theoretic distance.
