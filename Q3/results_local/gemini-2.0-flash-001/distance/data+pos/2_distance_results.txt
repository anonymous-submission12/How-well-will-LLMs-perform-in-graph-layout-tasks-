Let's analyze the given subgraph and node coordinates to determine the relationship between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance between nodes 3 and 25.

The subgraph edges are: (1, 2), (1, 24), (2, 3), (24, 25).
The node coordinates are:
- 3: [0.33, 0.23]
- 2: [0.11, 0.44]
- 1: [-0.16, 0.48]
- 24: [-0.6, 0.66]
- 25: [-0.77, 0.86]

First, let's calculate the graph-theoretic distance between nodes 3 and 25.  We need to find the shortest path between them in the graph.
- One possible path is 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 24 -> 25. This path has a length of 4.
Therefore, the graph-theoretic distance between 3 and 25 is 4.

Now, let's calculate the Euclidean distance between nodes 3 and 25 using their coordinates:
Euclidean distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
Euclidean distance (3, 25) = sqrt((-0.77 - 0.33)^2 + (0.86 - 0.23)^2)
= sqrt((-1.1)^2 + (0.63)^2)
= sqrt(1.21 + 0.3969)
= sqrt(1.6069)
â‰ˆ 1.2676

Since the Euclidean distance (approximately 1.2676) is less than the graph-theoretic distance (4), the answer is "Euclidean distance is less than graph-theoretic distance".
