Let's analyze the given subgraph data to determine the relationship between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance between nodes 21 and 12.

The subgraph data represents a path: 21 - 20 - 19 - 18 - 17 - 16 - 15 - 14 - 13 - 12.

The graph-theoretic distance is the number of edges in the shortest path between two nodes. In this case, the graph-theoretic distance between node 21 and node 12 is 9 (the number of edges in the path).

Now, let's consider the Euclidean distance. We have the coordinates for nodes 21 and 12:
- Node 21: (-0.7, -0.25)
- Node 12: (0.16, 0.64)

The Euclidean distance is calculated as:
sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) = sqrt((0.16 - (-0.7))^2 + (0.64 - (-0.25))^2) = sqrt((0.86)^2 + (0.89)^2) = sqrt(0.7396 + 0.7921) = sqrt(1.5317) â‰ˆ 1.2376

The Euclidean distance between nodes 21 and 12 is approximately 1.2376. The graph-theoretic distance is 9.

Since 1.2376 < 9, the Euclidean distance is less than the graph-theoretic distance.
