The subgraph data represents a path from node 7 to node 22. The graph-theoretic distance is the number of edges in the shortest path between the two nodes. In this case, the path is explicitly given, and the graph-theoretic distance between node 7 and node 22 is 15.

The Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between the coordinates of node 7 and node 22.
Node 7: (0.4, 0.74)
Node 22: (-0.47, -0.4)

Euclidean distance = sqrt((0.4 - (-0.47))^2 + (0.74 - (-0.4))^2)
= sqrt((0.87)^2 + (1.14)^2)
= sqrt(0.7569 + 1.2996)
= sqrt(2.0565)
= 1.434

Since 1.434 < 15, the Euclidean distance is less than the graph-theoretic distance.
