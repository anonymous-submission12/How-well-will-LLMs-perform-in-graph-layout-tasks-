The graph-theoretic distance between node 5 and node 14 is the number of edges in the shortest path between them, which is 9.

The Euclidean distance between node 5 and node 14 is calculated as follows:
sqrt((0.58 - (-0.13))^2 + (-0.24 - 0.67)^2) = sqrt((0.71)^2 + (-0.91)^2) = sqrt(0.5041 + 0.8281) = sqrt(1.3322) = 1.154

Since the Euclidean distance is 1.154 and the graph-theoretic distance is 9, the Euclidean distance is less than the graph-theoretic distance.
