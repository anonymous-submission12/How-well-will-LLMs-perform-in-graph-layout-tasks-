The graph-theoretic distance between node 16 and node 7 is the number of edges in the shortest path between them. In this case, the path is 16-15-14-13-12-11-10-9-8-7, which has 9 edges.

The Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between the coordinates of node 16 and node 7.
Node 16: [0.08, -0.21]
Node 7: [-0.2, 0.32]
Euclidean distance = sqrt((0.08 - (-0.2))^2 + (-0.21 - 0.32)^2) = sqrt((0.28)^2 + (-0.53)^2) = sqrt(0.0784 + 0.2809) = sqrt(0.3593) â‰ˆ 0.599

Since the graph-theoretic distance is 9 and the Euclidean distance is approximately 0.599, the Euclidean distance is less than the graph-theoretic distance.
