The graph-theoretic distance between node 25 and node 1 is the number of edges in the shortest path between them. In this case, the path is 25-24-23-22-21-20-19-18-17-16-1, which has 10 edges.

The Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between the coordinates of node 25 and node 1.
Node 25: [-0.33, -0.04]
Node 1: [0.56, -0.26]
Euclidean distance = sqrt((0.56 - (-0.33))^2 + (-0.26 - (-0.04))^2) = sqrt((0.89)^2 + (-0.22)^2) = sqrt(0.7921 + 0.0484) = sqrt(0.8405) = 0.9168

Since the Euclidean distance is 0.9168 and the graph-theoretic distance is 10, the Euclidean distance is less than the graph-theoretic distance.
