The path from node 44 to node 27 is 44 -> 51 -> 22 -> 13 -> 17 -> 32 -> 27. The graph-theoretic distance is 6. The Euclidean distance is the straight line distance between the coordinates of node 44 and node 27. Since the path is not a straight line, the Euclidean distance is less than the graph-theoretic distance.
