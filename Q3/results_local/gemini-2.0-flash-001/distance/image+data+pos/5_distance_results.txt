The graph-theoretic distance between node 57 and node 20 is the number of edges in the shortest path between them. From the given subgraph data, the path is: 57-56-55-54-53-52-51-50-49-48-47-46-45-44-43-42-41-40-39-38-37-36-35-34-33-32-31-30-29-28-27-26-25-24-23-22-21-20. The number of edges in this path is 37.

The Euclidean distance between node 57 and node 20 can be calculated using their coordinates:
Node 57: [-0.61, 0.7]
Node 20: [0.65, 0.18]
Euclidean distance = sqrt((0.65 - (-0.61))^2 + (0.18 - 0.7)^2) = sqrt((1.26)^2 + (-0.52)^2) = sqrt(1.5876 + 0.2704) = sqrt(1.858) â‰ˆ 1.363

Since the graph-theoretic distance is 37 and the Euclidean distance is approximately 1.363, the Euclidean distance is less than the graph-theoretic distance.
