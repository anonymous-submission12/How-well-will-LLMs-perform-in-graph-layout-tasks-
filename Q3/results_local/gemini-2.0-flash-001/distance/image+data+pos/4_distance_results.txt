The path from node 62 to node 24 is: 62 -> 37 -> 12 -> 13 -> 14 -> 15 -> 16 -> 17 -> 18 -> 19 -> 20 -> 21 -> 22 -> 23 -> 24. The graph-theoretic distance is 14.

The Euclidean distance between node 62 (0.67, 0.26) and node 24 (-0.84, 0.94) is:
sqrt((0.67 - (-0.84))^2 + (0.26 - 0.94)^2) = sqrt((1.51)^2 + (-0.68)^2) = sqrt(2.2801 + 0.4624) = sqrt(2.7425) = 1.656

Since 1.656 < 14, the Euclidean distance is less than the graph-theoretic distance.
