The graph theoretic distance between node 7 and node 22 is the number of edges in the shortest path between them, which is 15.
The Euclidean distance between node 7 and node 22 is calculated as follows:
sqrt((0.4 - (-0.47))^2 + (0.74 - (-0.4))^2) = sqrt((0.87)^2 + (1.14)^2) = sqrt(0.7569 + 1.2996) = sqrt(2.0565) = 1.434

Since 1.434 < 15, the Euclidean distance is less than the graph-theoretic distance.
