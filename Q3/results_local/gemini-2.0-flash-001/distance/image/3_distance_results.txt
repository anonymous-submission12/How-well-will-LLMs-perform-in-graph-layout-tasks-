The path from node 7 to node 22 is not a straight line. The Euclidean distance is the straight line distance between the two nodes, while the graph-theoretic distance is the distance along the edges of the graph. In this case, the path is curved, so the graph-theoretic distance is greater than the Euclidean distance.
