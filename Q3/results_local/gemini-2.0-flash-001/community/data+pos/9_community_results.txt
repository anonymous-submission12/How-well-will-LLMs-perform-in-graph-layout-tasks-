Based on the provided node coordinates, we can visually identify three distinct spatial clusters:

1.  A cluster centered around (0.2, 0.0). This includes nodes with relatively small x and y coordinates.
2.  A cluster centered around (0.0, -0.8). This includes nodes with x coordinates near 0 and negative y coordinates.
3.  A cluster centered around (-0.25, 0.8). This includes nodes with negative x coordinates and positive y coordinates.

Therefore, the estimated number of communities is 3.
