Based on the provided node coordinates, we can visually identify three potential clusters:

1.  Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 appear to form a cluster in the upper-middle right of the coordinate space.
2.  Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 seem to form a cluster in the lower-middle of the coordinate space.
3.  Nodes 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20 appear to form a cluster on the left side of the coordinate space.

Therefore, based on the spatial distribution of the nodes, we can estimate that there are 3 communities.
