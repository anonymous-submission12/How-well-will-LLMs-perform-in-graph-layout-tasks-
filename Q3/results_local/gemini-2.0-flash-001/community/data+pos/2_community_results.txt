Based on the provided graph layout and node coordinates, we can visually identify three distinct spatial clusters:

1.  Nodes 0-9, which are located in the upper right quadrant (positive x, negative y).
2.  Nodes 10-19, which are located in the lower left quadrant (negative x, negative y).
3.  Nodes 20-29, which are located in the upper left quadrant (negative x, positive y).

Therefore, the estimated number of communities is 3.
