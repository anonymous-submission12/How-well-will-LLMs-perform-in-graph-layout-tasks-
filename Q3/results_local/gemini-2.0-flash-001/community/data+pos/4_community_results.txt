Based on the provided graph layout and node coordinates, we can visually inspect the spatial distribution of the nodes to estimate the number of communities.

Nodes 0-6 appear to form a cluster in the upper-center region. Nodes 7-13 form another cluster in the upper-right region. Nodes 14-20 form a cluster in the lower-left region. Therefore, based on the spatial distribution, we can estimate that there are 3 communities.
