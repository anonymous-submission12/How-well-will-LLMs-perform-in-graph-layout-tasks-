Based on the provided node coordinates, we can visually identify two distinct spatial clusters:

1.  Nodes with x-coordinates generally between 0 and 1 and y-coordinates between -0.85 and -0.32.
2.  Nodes with x-coordinates generally between -0.87 and -0.32 and y-coordinates between 0.32 and 0.85.

Therefore, the estimated number of communities is 2.
