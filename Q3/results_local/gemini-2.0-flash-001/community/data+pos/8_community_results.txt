Based on the provided node coordinates, we can visually identify four distinct spatial clusters:

1.  Nodes 0-14: Located in the upper-right quadrant.
2.  Nodes 15-29: Located in the lower-left quadrant.
3.  Nodes 30-44: Located in the center-left.
4.  Nodes 45-59: Located in the center.
5.  Nodes 60-74: Located in the upper-center.

Therefore, based on the spatial distribution of the nodes, we can estimate that there are 5 communities.
