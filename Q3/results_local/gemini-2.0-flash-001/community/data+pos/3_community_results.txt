The node coordinates suggest the presence of distinct spatial clusters. Visual inspection (which is what we're simulating) reveals the following:

*   Nodes 0-7 and 14 appear to form a cluster in the lower-left.
*   Nodes 8-14 and 18 form a cluster in the center-left.
*   Nodes 15-21 form a cluster in the center.
*   Nodes 22-28 form a cluster in the upper-right.

Therefore, based on the spatial distribution of the nodes, there appear to be 4 communities.
