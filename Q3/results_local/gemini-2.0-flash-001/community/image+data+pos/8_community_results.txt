Based on the node coordinates and the graph data, we can observe the following spatial clusters:

1.  Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14: Located in the top-right corner.
2.  Nodes 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 40: Located in the bottom-left corner.
3.  Nodes 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 53: Located in the center-left.
4.  Nodes 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59: Located in the center-right.
5.  Nodes 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74: Located in the top-right.

Therefore, based on the spatial distribution of the nodes, we can estimate that there are 5 communities.
