Based on the provided graph layout and node coordinates, I can identify four distinct spatial clusters:

1.  Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6: Located in the upper-right.
2.  Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13: Located in the upper-left.
3.  Nodes 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20: Located in the middle-left.
4.  Nodes 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27: Located in the middle-right.

Therefore, the estimated number of communities is 4.
