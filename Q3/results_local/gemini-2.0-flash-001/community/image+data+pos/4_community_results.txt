Based on the node coordinates and the graph layout, I can identify three distinct spatial clusters:

1.  Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6: These nodes are located in the top-left part of the graph.
2.  Nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13: These nodes are located in the top-right part of the graph.
3.  Nodes 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20: These nodes are located in the bottom-left part of the graph.

Therefore, the estimated number of communities is 3.
