Based on the node coordinates and the graph data, we can observe three distinct spatial clusters. The first cluster is formed by nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The second cluster is formed by nodes 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. The third cluster is formed by nodes 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29. Therefore, the estimated number of communities is 3.
