Based on the node coordinates and the graph layout, we can visually identify three distinct clusters of nodes. The first cluster is formed by nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The second cluster consists of nodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13. The third cluster is formed by nodes 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20. Therefore, the estimated number of communities is 3.
