Let's denote the two edges as AB and CD, where A, B, C, and D are the nodes. The coordinates of the nodes are given as follows:

A = node '2' = (-0.67, 0.44)
B = node '1' = (-0.8, 0.57)
C = node '3' = (-0.69, 0.52)
D = node '6' = (-0.74, 0.36)

To determine if the line segments AB and CD intersect, we can use the concept of orientation.  The orientation of three points (A, B, C) is a measure of the "direction" we turn as we travel from A to B to C.  It can be clockwise, counterclockwise, or collinear.

We can calculate the orientation using the following formula:

orientation(A, B, C) = (B.x - A.x) * (C.y - B.y) - (B.y - A.y) * (C.x - B.x)

If orientation(A, B, C) > 0, then A, B, and C are in counterclockwise order.
If orientation(A, B, C) < 0, then A, B, and C are in clockwise order.
If orientation(A, B, C) = 0, then A, B, and C are collinear.

Two line segments AB and CD intersect if and only if one of the following two conditions is true:

1.  General Case:
    *   orientation(A, B, C) * orientation(A, B, D) < 0  AND  orientation(C, D, A) * orientation(C, D, B) < 0

2.  Special Case (Collinear):  We also need to check if the points are collinear and overlapping.  However, given the nature of the coordinates, it's highly unlikely that we'll encounter perfect collinearity with floating-point numbers.  Therefore, we'll focus on the general case.

Let's calculate the orientations:

orientation(A, B, C) = (-0.8 - (-0.67)) * (0.52 - 0.57) - (0.57 - 0.44) * (-0.69 - (-0.8))
= (-0.13) * (-0.05) - (0.13) * (0.11)
= 0.0065 - 0.0143
= -0.0078

orientation(A, B, D) = (-0.8 - (-0.67)) * (0.36 - 0.57) - (0.57 - 0.44) * (-0.74 - (-0.8))
= (-0.13) * (-0.21) - (0.13) * (0.06)
= 0.0273 - 0.0078
= 0.0195

orientation(C, D, A) = (-0.74 - (-0.69)) * (0.44 - 0.36) - (0.36 - 0.52) * (-0.67 - (-0.74))
= (-0.05) * (0.08) - (-0.16) * (0.07)
= -0.004 + 0.0112
= 0.0072

orientation(C, D, B) = (-0.74 - (-0.69)) * (0.57 - 0.36) - (0.36 - 0.52) * (-0.8 - (-0.74))
= (-0.05) * (0.21) - (-0.16) * (-0.06)
= -0.0105 - 0.0096
= -0.0201

Now, let's check the conditions:

orientation(A, B, C) * orientation(A, B, D) = (-0.0078) * (0.0195) = -0.0001521 < 0
orientation(C, D, A) * orientation(C, D, B) = (0.0072) * (-0.0201) = -0.00014472 < 0

Since both conditions are met, the line segments intersect.
