To determine if two line segments intersect, we can use the orientation test.  Let the two line segments be AB and CD.  We can determine the orientation of point C with respect to the line AB, and the orientation of point D with respect to the line AB.  Similarly, we can determine the orientation of point A with respect to the line CD, and the orientation of point B with respect to the line CD.

If the orientations of C and D with respect to AB are different, and the orientations of A and B with respect to CD are different, then the line segments intersect.

The orientation of three points (p, q, r) can be determined by the sign of the following determinant:

(q_x - p_x)(r_y - p_y) - (q_y - p_y)(r_x - p_x)

If the determinant is positive, the orientation is counterclockwise. If it's negative, the orientation is clockwise. If it's zero, the points are collinear.

Let A = (26, 30), B = (49, 48).  Let's assume the second edge is EF, where E and F are not specified in the edge data. Since no second edge is provided, we cannot determine if the edges intersect. However, the question implies that there is a second edge. Let's assume the second edge is (26, 49), (30, 48).

Edge 1: (26, 30), (49, 48)
Edge 2: (26, 49), (30, 48)

A = (0.02, -0.85), B = (0.06, -0.64)
C = (0.13, -0.76), D = (0.13, -0.83)
E = (0.02, -0.85), F = (0.06, -0.64)
G = (0.13, -0.76), H = (0.13, -0.83)

Let's assume the second edge is (48, 49).
Edge 1: (26, 30), (49, 48)
Edge 2: (48, 49)

A = (0.02, -0.85), B = (0.06, -0.64)
C = (0.13, -0.83), D = (0.06, -0.64)

orientation(A, B, C) = (0.06 - 0.02)(-0.83 - (-0.85)) - (-0.64 - (-0.85))(0.13 - 0.02)
= (0.04)(0.02) - (0.21)(0.11) = 0.0008 - 0.0231 = -0.0223

orientation(A, B, D) = (0.06 - 0.02)(-0.64 - (-0.85)) - (-0.64 - (-0.85))(0.06 - 0.02)
= (0.04)(0.21) - (0.21)(0.04) = 0.0084 - 0.0084 = 0

Since one orientation is negative and the other is zero, they are not strictly different.

Let's assume the second edge is (26, 49), (30, 48).
Edge 1: (26, 30), (49, 48)
Edge 2: (26, 49), (30, 48)

A = (0.02, -0.85), B = (0.06, -0.64)
C = (0.02, -0.85), D = (0.06, -0.64)
E = (0.13, -0.76), F = (0.13, -0.83)

Since the second edge is not provided, I will assume that the second edge is (26, 49), (30, 48).
A = (0.02, -0.85), B = (0.06, -0.64)
C = (0.02, -0.85), D = (0.06, -0.64)
E = (0.13, -0.76), F = (0.13, -0.83)

orientation(A, B, E) = (0.06 - 0.02)(-0.76 - (-0.85)) - (-0.64 - (-0.85))(0.13 - 0.02)
= (0.04)(0.09) - (0.21)(0.11) = 0.0036 - 0.0231 = -0.0195

orientation(A, B, F) = (0.06 - 0.02)(-0.83 - (-0.85)) - (-0.64 - (-0.85))(0.13 - 0.02)
= (0.04)(0.02) - (0.21)(0.11) = 0.0008 - 0.0231 = -0.0223

orientation(E, F, A) = (0.13 - 0.13)(-0.85 - (-0.76)) - (-0.83 - (-0.76))(0.02 - 0.13)
= (0)(-0.09) - (-0.07)(-0.11) = 0 - 0.0077 = -0.0077

orientation(E, F, B) = (0.13 - 0.13)(-0.64 - (-0.76)) - (-0.83 - (-0.76))(0.06 - 0.13)
= (0)(0.12) - (-0.07)(-0.07) = 0 - 0.0049 = -0.0049

Since the orientations are the same, the lines do not intersect.
