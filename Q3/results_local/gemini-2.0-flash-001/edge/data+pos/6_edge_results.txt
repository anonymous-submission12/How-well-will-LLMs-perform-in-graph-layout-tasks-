To determine if two line segments intersect, we can use the orientation test.  Let the two line segments be AB and CD.  We can determine the orientation of point C with respect to the line AB, and the orientation of point D with respect to the line AB.  Similarly, we can determine the orientation of point A with respect to the line CD, and the orientation of point B with respect to the line CD.  If the orientations of C and D with respect to AB are different, and the orientations of A and B with respect to CD are different, then the line segments intersect.

The orientation of three points (p1, p2, p3) can be determined by the sign of the following determinant:
(p2.x - p1.x) * (p3.y - p1.y) - (p2.y - p1.y) * (p3.x - p1.x)

If the determinant is positive, the orientation is counterclockwise.
If the determinant is negative, the orientation is clockwise.
If the determinant is zero, the points are collinear.

Let's denote the edge as AB and CD.
A = (24, 15), B = (46, 49)
C = (24, 15), D = (46, 49)

A_coords = [-0.15, 0.19]
B_coords = [0.36, 0.1]
C_coords = [-0.15, 0.19]
D_coords = [0.36, 0.1]

Since the two edges are identical, they intersect.
