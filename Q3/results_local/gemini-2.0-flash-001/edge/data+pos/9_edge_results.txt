Let's denote the edges as follows:
Edge 1: (0, 2) with coordinates A = (0.3, 0.3) and B = (0.57, 0.65)
Edge 2: (1, 6) with coordinates C = (0.33, 0.67) and D = (0.49, 0.48)

We can determine if two line segments AB and CD intersect using the orientation test. The orientation of three points (p, q, r) can be clockwise, counterclockwise, or collinear.

Orientation can be determined by the sign of the following determinant:
(q_y - p_y) * (r_x - q_x) - (q_x - p_x) * (r_y - q_y)

If the orientation is:
- > 0: Counterclockwise
- < 0: Clockwise
- = 0: Collinear

Two line segments AB and CD intersect if and only if one of the following two conditions is true:

1.  General Case:
    *   orientation(A, B, C) != orientation(A, B, D) AND
    orientation(C, D, A) != orientation(C, D, B)

2.  Special Case (Collinear):
    *   orientation(A, B, C) == 0 AND point C lies on segment AB
    *   orientation(A, B, D) == 0 AND point D lies on segment AB
    *   orientation(C, D, A) == 0 AND point A lies on segment CD
    *   orientation(C, D, B) == 0 AND point B lies on segment CD

Let's calculate the orientations:

orientation(A, B, C) = (0.65 - 0.3) * (0.33 - 0.57) - (0.57 - 0.3) * (0.67 - 0.3)
= 0.35 * (-0.24) - 0.27 * 0.37
= -0.084 - 0.099
= -0.183

orientation(A, B, D) = (0.65 - 0.3) * (0.49 - 0.57) - (0.57 - 0.3) * (0.48 - 0.3)
= 0.35 * (-0.08) - 0.27 * 0.18
= -0.028 - 0.0486
= -0.0766

orientation(C, D, A) = (0.48 - 0.67) * (0.3 - 0.49) - (0.49 - 0.33) * (0.3 - 0.67)
= -0.19 * (-0.19) - 0.16 * (-0.37)
= 0.0361 + 0.0592
= 0.0953

orientation(C, D, B) = (0.48 - 0.67) * (0.57 - 0.49) - (0.49 - 0.33) * (0.65 - 0.67)
= -0.19 * 0.08 - 0.16 * (-0.02)
= -0.0152 + 0.0032
= -0.012

Since orientation(A, B, C) and orientation(A, B, D) have the same sign (-), and orientation(C, D, A) and orientation(C, D, B) have opposite signs (+ and -), the edges do not intersect.
