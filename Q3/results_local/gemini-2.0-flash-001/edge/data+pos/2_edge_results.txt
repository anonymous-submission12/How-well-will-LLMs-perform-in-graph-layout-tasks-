To determine if two line segments intersect, we can use the orientation test.  Given two line segments AB and CD, we can determine if they intersect by checking the orientations of the following triplets of points:

1.  A, B, C
2.  A, B, D
3.  C, D, A
4.  C, D, B

If the orientations of (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) are different, and the orientations of (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) are different, then the line segments intersect.  If any of the orientations are collinear (i.e., the orientation is 0), we need to handle those cases separately.

The orientation of three points (p, q, r) can be calculated using the following formula:

orientation = (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - q.x) - (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - q.y)

If orientation > 0, the points are in counterclockwise order.
If orientation < 0, the points are in clockwise order.
If orientation = 0, the points are collinear.

Let's apply this to the given data:

Edge 1: (0, 4)
Edge 2: (21, 20)

Node coordinates:
0: (-0.17, -0.0)
4: (-0.25, 0.14)
21: (-0.0, -0.26)
20: (0.13, -0.27)

A = (0) = (-0.17, -0.0)
B = (4) = (-0.25, 0.14)
C = (21) = (-0.0, -0.26)
D = (20) = (0.13, -0.27)

Orientation(A, B, C) = (-0.25 - (-0.17)) * (-0.26 - 0.14) - (-0.0 - (-0.17)) * (-0.0 - 0.14)
= (-0.08) * (-0.4) - (0.17) * (-0.14)
= 0.032 + 0.0238 = 0.0558 > 0

Orientation(A, B, D) = (-0.25 - (-0.17)) * (-0.27 - 0.14) - (0.13 - (-0.17)) * (-0.0 - 0.14)
= (-0.08) * (-0.41) - (0.3) * (-0.14)
= 0.0328 + 0.042 = 0.0748 > 0

Orientation(C, D, A) = (-0.27 - (-0.26)) * (-0.17 - 0.13) - (-0.0 - 0.13) * (-0.0 - (-0.26))
= (-0.01) * (-0.3) - (-0.13) * (0.26)
= 0.003 + 0.0338 = 0.0368 > 0

Orientation(C, D, B) = (-0.27 - (-0.26)) * (-0.25 - 0.13) - (-0.0 - 0.13) * (0.14 - (-0.26))
= (-0.01) * (-0.38) - (-0.13) * (0.4)
= 0.0038 + 0.052 = 0.0558 > 0

Since Orientation(A, B, C) and Orientation(A, B, D) have the same sign, and Orientation(C, D, A) and Orientation(C, D, B) have the same sign, the line segments do not intersect.
