Let's denote the two line segments as AB and CD, where A, B, C, and D are the coordinates of the nodes.
A = (0.61, 0.16)
B = (0.7, -0.1)
C = (0.49, 0.0)
D = (0.74, 0.07)

We can use the orientation test to determine if the line segments intersect. The orientation test checks the sign of the cross product of the vectors formed by the points.

Orientation(A, B, C) = (B.x - A.x) * (C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y) * (C.x - A.x)
Orientation(A, B, D) = (B.x - A.x) * (D.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y) * (D.x - A.x)
Orientation(C, D, A) = (D.x - C.x) * (A.y - C.y) - (D.y - C.y) * (A.x - C.x)
Orientation(C, D, B) = (D.x - C.x) * (B.y - C.y) - (D.y - C.y) * (B.x - C.x)

If Orientation(A, B, C) * Orientation(A, B, D) < 0 and Orientation(C, D, A) * Orientation(C, D, B) < 0, then the line segments intersect.

Orientation(A, B, C) = (0.7 - 0.61) * (0.0 - 0.16) - (-0.1 - 0.16) * (0.49 - 0.61)
= (0.09) * (-0.16) - (-0.26) * (-0.12)
= -0.0144 - 0.0312
= -0.0456

Orientation(A, B, D) = (0.7 - 0.61) * (0.07 - 0.16) - (-0.1 - 0.16) * (0.74 - 0.61)
= (0.09) * (-0.09) - (-0.26) * (0.13)
= -0.0081 + 0.0338
= 0.0257

Orientation(C, D, A) = (0.74 - 0.49) * (0.16 - 0.0) - (0.07 - 0.0) * (0.61 - 0.49)
= (0.25) * (0.16) - (0.07) * (0.12)
= 0.04 - 0.0084
= 0.0316

Orientation(C, D, B) = (0.74 - 0.49) * (-0.1 - 0.0) - (0.07 - 0.0) * (0.7 - 0.49)
= (0.25) * (-0.1) - (0.07) * (0.21)
= -0.025 - 0.0147
= -0.0397

Orientation(A, B, C) * Orientation(A, B, D) = -0.0456 * 0.0257 = -0.001172
Orientation(C, D, A) * Orientation(C, D, B) = 0.0316 * (-0.0397) = -0.001254

Since both products are negative, the line segments intersect.
