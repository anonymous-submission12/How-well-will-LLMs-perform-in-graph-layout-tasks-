To estimate the number of communities based on the spatial clustering patterns in the graph layout, we can observe the coordinates provided for the nodes. The spatial distribution of the nodes suggests there are distinct clusters around specific areas:

1. **Cluster around negative x and y coordinates:** Nodes such as `20`, `22`, `19`, `21`, `27`, `28`, `36`, etc., seem to form one spatially close community.
   
2. **Cluster in the positive y and negative x range:** Nodes like `56`, `57`, `64`, `71`, `72`, `69`, `66`, and `62` form another cluster.

3. **Cluster around positive x and y coordinates (upper-right area):** Nodes like `38`, `39`, `40`, `43`, `44`, `46`, `48`, `49`, `51`, etc., form another tightly connected community.

4. **Cluster in the negative y and positive x range:** Nodes like `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `15`, etc., form another community.

5. **Additional smaller clusters:** We might identify smaller communities such as disconnected or weakly connected nodes in the spatial layout.

Through visual inspection, the graph layout exhibits **4 major spatial clusters** or communities.
