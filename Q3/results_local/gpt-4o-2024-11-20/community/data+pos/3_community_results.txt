To estimate the number of communities based on the spatial clustering patterns in the graph layout, we can observe the node coordinates and their clustering tendencies. Nodes that are spatially close to each other and have dense connections are likely to form a community. Based on the provided data:

1. Nodes `0` to `7` and `14` are clustered around the coordinates `[-0.83, 0.18]` and form a dense group. This is one community.
2. Nodes `8` to `14` are clustered around the coordinates `[-0.06, -0.35]` and form another dense group. This is the second community.
3. Nodes `15` to `21` and `25` are clustered around the coordinates `[0.58, -0.12]` and form a dense group. This is the third community.
4. Nodes `22` to `28` are clustered around the coordinates `[0.61, 0.63]` and form another dense group. This is the fourth community.

Thus, there are **4 communities** in the graph.
