To estimate the number of communities, we analyze the spatial clustering patterns using the node coordinates provided. From the coordinates, nodes are visually clustered in distinct groups. Each group corresponds to a possible community. Based on the data:

1. A tight cluster around `(0.1, -0.16)` appears to form one community.
2. Another distinct cluster around `(0.02, -0.69)`.
3. A separate cluster around `(-0.19, 0.74)` representing another group.
4. Additional nodes around `(-0.42, 0.85)` suggest subdivisions which likely join the third cluster, but the broad clusters are distinct.  

Thus conclude finally third
