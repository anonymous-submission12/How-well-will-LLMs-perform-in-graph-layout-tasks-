To estimate the number of communities based on spatial clustering patterns, we can analyze the node coordinates and their connectivity. Nodes that are spatially close and densely connected are likely to belong to the same community. Based on the given data:

1. **Cluster 1**: Nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} are spatially close and densely connected.
2. **Cluster 2**: Nodes {7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13} are spatially close and densely connected.
3. **Cluster 3**: Nodes {14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20} are spatially close and densely connected.

Thus, there are **3 communities** in the graph.
