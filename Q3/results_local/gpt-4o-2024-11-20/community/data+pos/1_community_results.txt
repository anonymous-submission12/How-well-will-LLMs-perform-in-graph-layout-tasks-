To determine the number of communities based on the graph layout and spatial clustering patterns:

1. **Observation of Clusters:** Based on the node coordinates, the nodes appear to form distinct spatial clusters.
   - Nodes near `(0.3, 0.3)` are tightly grouped: **Cluster 1** (nodes: `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`).
   - Nodes near `(0.27, -0.3)` and below form another group: **Cluster 2** (nodes: `{7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}`).
   - Nodes near `(-0.72, -0.08)` and above form another group: **Cluster 3** (nodes: `{14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}`).

2. **Community Structure:** From the connectivity (edges) and the spatial clustering, it is evident that these three spatial groups form three distinct communities.
