To determine the number of communities based on the spatial clustering patterns in the given graph data, we can visually analyze the node coordinates to identify distinct regions where nodes form clusters. 

Upon inspection of node coordinates:

1. **Cluster 1**: Nodes with negative x and negative y values in the range [-0.52, -0.01] for x and [-0.96, -0.3] for y.
   - This forms a noticeable cluster of nodes mostly concentrated in the negative x and y quadrant.
   
2. **Cluster 2**: Nodes with positive x and y values in the range [0.01, 0.47] for x and [0.26, 1.0] for y.
   - This is a second distinct cluster where positive x and y coordinates dominate.

Based on the spatial clustering patterns, there appear to be **two distinct communities**.
