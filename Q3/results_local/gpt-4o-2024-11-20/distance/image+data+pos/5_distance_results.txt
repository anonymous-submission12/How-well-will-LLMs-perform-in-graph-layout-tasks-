To assess the consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance for the source node 57 and target node 20, we need to calculate both distances:

### Step 1: Euclidean Distance
The Euclidean distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

Coordinates of node 57: \([-0.61, 0.7]\)  
Coordinates of node 20: \([0.65, 0.18]\)

\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(0.65 - (-0.61))^2 + (0.18 - 0.7)^2}
\]
\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(0.65 + 0.61)^2 + (0.18 - 0.7)^2}
\]
\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(1.26)^2 + (-0.52)^2}
\]
\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{1.5876 + 0.2704} = \sqrt{1.858} \approx 1.363
\]

### Step 2: Graph-Theoretic Distance
The graph-theoretic distance is the shortest path between the source and target nodes in terms of the number of edges. From the graph data, the path from node 57 to node 20 traverses all intermediate nodes (56, 55, ..., 21). The number of edges is:
\[
\text{Graph-Theoretic Distance} = 57 - 20 = 37 \text{ edges}
\]

### Step 3: Comparison
The graph-theoretic distance (37 edges) is significantly larger than the Euclidean distance (\(\approx 1.363\)). This indicates that the Euclidean distance is less than the graph-theoretic distance.
