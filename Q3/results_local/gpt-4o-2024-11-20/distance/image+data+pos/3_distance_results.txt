To assess the consistency between the Euclidean distance and the graph-theoretic distance between the source node 7 and the target node 22, we calculate both distances:

### Step 1: Graph-Theoretic Distance
The graph-theoretic distance is the shortest path between the source and target nodes in terms of the number of edges. From the subgraph data, the path from node 7 to node 22 is:
```
7 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 13 → 14 → 15 → 16 → 17 → 18 → 19 → 20 → 21 → 22
```
This path contains 15 edges. Therefore, the graph-theoretic distance is:
```
Graph-Theoretic Distance = 15
```

### Step 2: Euclidean Distance
The Euclidean distance is calculated using the coordinates of nodes 7 and 22. The formula for Euclidean distance is:
\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
From the node coordinates:
- Node 7: \((x_1, y_1) = (0.4, 0.74)\)
- Node 22: \((x_2, y_2) = (-0.47, -0.4)\)

Substituting these values:
\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(-0.47 - 0.4)^2 + (-0.4 - 0.74)^2}
\]
\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(-0.87)^2 + (-1.14)^2}
\]
\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{0.7569 + 1.2996}
\]
\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{2.0565} \approx 1.434
\]

### Step 3: Comparison
- Graph-Theoretic Distance = 15
- Euclidean Distance ≈ 1.434

Clearly:
\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} < \text{Graph-Theoretic Distance}
\]
