To assess the consistency between the Euclidean distance and the graph-theoretic distance, let's calculate both and compare. 

### Graph-theoretic Distance:
The graph-theoretic distance is the shortest path between the source node (3) and target node (25) along the edges of the graph. The path is:

3 → 2 → 1 → 24 → 25.  
This path has 4 edges, so the graph-theoretic distance is:

**4**

### Euclidean Distance:
We calculate the Euclidean distance directly between the coordinates of source node (3) and target node (25). The coordinates are:

- Node 3: [0.33, 0.23]
- Node 25: [-0.77, 0.86]

Euclidean distance formula:
\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

Plugging in the values:
\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{((-0.77 - 0.33)^2 + (0.86 - 0.23)^2)} = \sqrt{((-1.1)^2 + (0.63)^2)} = \sqrt{1.21 + 0.3969} = \sqrt{1.6069} \approx 1.267
\]

**Euclidean distance ≈ 1.267**

### Comparison:
- Graph-theoretic distance = 4
- Euclidean distance ≈ 1.267

Clearly, the **Euclidean distance is less than the graph-theoretic distance**.
