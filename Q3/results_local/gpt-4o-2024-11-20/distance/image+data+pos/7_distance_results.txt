To assess the consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance for the source node 44 and target node 27, we need to calculate both distances:

### Step 1: Calculate Euclidean Distance
The Euclidean distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

Coordinates:
- Node 44: \([-0.55, 0.63]\)
- Node 27: \([0.69, -0.22]\)

\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(0.69 - (-0.55))^2 + (-0.22 - 0.63)^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{(0.69 + 0.55)^2 + (-0.22 - 0.63)^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{(1.24)^2 + (-0.85)^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{1.5376 + 0.7225}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{2.2601} \approx 1.503
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Graph-Theoretic Distance
The graph-theoretic distance is the shortest path between nodes in terms of edges. From the subgraph data:
- Path from node 44 to node 27: \(44 \to 51 \to 22 \to 13 \to 17 \to 32 \to 27\)
- Number of edges: \(6\)

Assuming each edge represents a unit distance, the graph-theoretic distance is \(6\).

### Step 3: Compare Distances
- Euclidean Distance: \(1.503\)
- Graph-Theoretic Distance: \(6\)

Clearly, the Euclidean distance is less than the graph-theoretic distance.
