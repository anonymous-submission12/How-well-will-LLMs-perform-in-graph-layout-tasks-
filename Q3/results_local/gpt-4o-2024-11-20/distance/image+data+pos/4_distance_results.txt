To assess whether the relationship between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance is maintained, we need to calculate the Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance between the source node (62) and target node (24):

### Calculation 1: Euclidean Distance
The Euclidean distance can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
Here, coordinates for:
- Node 62 are \([0.67, 0.26]\),
- Node 24 are \([-0.84, 0.94]\).

Using the formula:
\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(0.67 - (-0.84))^2 + (0.26 - 0.94)^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{(0.67 + 0.84)^2 + (0.26 - 0.94)^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{(1.51)^2 + (-0.68)^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{2.2801 + 0.4624} = \sqrt{2.7425} \approx 1.656
\]

### Calculation 2: Graph-Theoretic Distance
The graph-theoretic distance is the shortest path length in terms of edge count between the two nodes. The given subgraph indicates the following shortest path for node 62 (source) to node 24 (target):
- Path: \(62 \rightarrow 37 \rightarrow 12 \rightarrow 13 \rightarrow 14 \rightarrow 15 \rightarrow 16 \rightarrow 17 \rightarrow 18 \rightarrow 19 \rightarrow 20 \rightarrow 21 \rightarrow 22 \rightarrow 23 \rightarrow 24\),
- Number of edges in the path: \(14\).

### Comparison
From the above calculations:
- **Euclidean Distance**: \(1.656\),
- **Graph-Theoretic Distance (edge count)**: \(14\).

Since the Euclidean distance (\(1.656\)) is significantly less than the graph-theoretic distance (\(14\)), the answer is:
