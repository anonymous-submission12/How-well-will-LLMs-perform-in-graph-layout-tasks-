To evaluate the relationship between the graph-theoretic distance and the Euclidean distance, let's proceed step by step:

1. **Graph-Theoretic Distance**: This is the number of edges connecting the source and target nodes in the subgraph.
   - The edges connecting node 25 to node 1 are:
     ```
     25 -> 24 -> 23 -> 22 -> 21 -> 20 -> 19 -> 18 -> 17 -> 16 -> 1
     ```
   - Thus, the graph-theoretic distance between node 25 and node 1 is **10 edges**.

2. **Euclidean Distance**: This is the straight-line distance between the coordinates of node 25 and node 1.
   - Node 25 has coordinates: [-0.33, -0.04]
   - Node 1 has coordinates: [0.56, -0.26]

   Using the Euclidean distance formula:
   \[
   \text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
   \]
   Substituting:
   \[
   \text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(0.56 - (-0.33))^2 + (-0.26 - (-0.04))^2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(0.56 + 0.33)^2 + (-0.26 + 0.04)^2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(0.89)^2 + (-0.22)^2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{0.7921 + 0.0484}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{0.8405} \approx 0.9167
   \]

3. **Comparison of Distances**:
   - Graph-Theoretic Distance: 10 edges
   - Euclidean Distance: Approximately 0.9167
   
   Clearly, the **Euclidean Distance is less than the Graph-Theoretic Distance**, because traveling through the graph requires traversing 10 edges, which is much longer than the direct straight-line distance between the nodes.
