To assess consistency between the Euclidean and graph-theoretic distances from node 16 (source) to node 7 (target), let us calculate both:

### Step 1: Euclidean Distance
Using the formula \( \text{distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \):
1. Coordinates for node 16: (0.08, -0.21)
2. Coordinates for node 7: (-0.2, 0.32)

\[
\text{Euclidean distance} = \sqrt{(0.08 - (-0.2))^2 + (-0.21 - 0.32)^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{(0.28)^2 + (-0.53)^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{0.0784 + 0.2809}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{0.3593} \approx 0.5994
\]

### Step 2: Graph-Theoretic Distance
The graph-theoretic distance represents the shortest path between node 16 and node 7 along graph edges. The path from nodes 16 → 15 → 14 → 13 → 12 → 11 → 10 → 9 → 8 → 7 involves 9 edges. Assuming unit edge weights, the graph-theoretic distance is:
\[
\text{Graph-theoretic distance} = 9 \text{ units}
\]

### Step 3: Comparison
1. **Euclidean distance**: \( \approx 0.5994 \)
2. **Graph-theoretic distance**: \( 9 \text{ units} \)

Clearly, the Euclidean distance is significantly less than the graph-theoretic distance.
