To assess the consistency between the Euclidean distance and the graph-theoretic distance for the source node 22 and target node 9, let's calculate both distances:

### Step 1: Graph-Theoretic Distance
The graph-theoretic distance is the shortest path between the source and target nodes in terms of the number of edges. From the subgraph data:
- Path from 22 to 9: 22 → 19 → 1 → 8 → 9
- Number of edges: 4

Thus, the graph-theoretic distance is **4**.

### Step 2: Euclidean Distance
The Euclidean distance is calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
Coordinates of the nodes:
- Node 22: \((-0.53, -0.55)\)
- Node 9: \((0.82, 0.53)\)

Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(0.82 - (-0.53))^2 + (0.53 - (-0.55))^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{(0.82 + 0.53)^2 + (0.53 + 0.55)^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{(1.35)^2 + (1.08)^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{1.8225 + 1.1664}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{2.9889} \approx 1.73
\]

### Step 3: Comparison
- Graph-theoretic distance: **4**
- Euclidean distance: **1.73**

Since \(1.73 < 4\), the Euclidean distance is **less than** the graph-theoretic distance.
