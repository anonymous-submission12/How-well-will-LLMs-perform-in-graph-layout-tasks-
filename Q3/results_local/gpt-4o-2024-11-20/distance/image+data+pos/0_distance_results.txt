To assess the consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance between nodes 5 (source) and 14 (target), we calculate both metrics.

### Graph-Theoretic Distance:
The path connecting node 5 to node 14 in the given graph has the following edges:
- (5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 13 → 14).

The number of edges in this path is **9**. Hence, the graph-theoretic distance is **9**.

### Euclidean Distance:
We use the Euclidean distance formula between (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂):
\[
d = \sqrt{(x₂ - x₁)^2 + (y₂ - y₁)^2}.
\]

Coordinates of nodes 5 and 14 are:
- Node 5: (0.58, -0.24)
- Node 14: (-0.13, 0.67)

\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{((-0.13) - 0.58)^2 + ((0.67) - (-0.24))^2}.
\]

\[
= \sqrt{(-0.71)^2 + (0.91)^2}
\]

\[
= \sqrt{0.5041 + 0.8281} = \sqrt{1.3322} \approx 1.154.
\]

### Comparison:
- **Graph-Theoretic Distance** = 9
- **Euclidean Distance** ≈ 1.154

Clearly, the Euclidean distance is **much less** than the graph-theoretic distance.
