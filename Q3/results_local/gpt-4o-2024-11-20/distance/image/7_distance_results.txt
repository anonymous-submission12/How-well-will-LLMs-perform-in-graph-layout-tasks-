Based on the image provided, the graph-theoretic distance (shortest path along the edges) between the source node (44) and the target node (27) is equal to the number of edges connecting them. The Euclidean distance (straight-line distance) between the source and target nodes appears to be shorter than the graph-theoretic distance because the path is not a straight line but follows the edges of the graph.

**Final Answer:**
```json
{
  "Answer": "Euclidean distance is less than graph-theoretic distance"
}
