Based on the visual inspection of the graph:

- The Euclidean distance between the source node 5 and the target node 14 is the straight-line distance between them.
- The graph-theoretic distance is the sum of the edges along the shortest path connecting the two nodes.

From the image, the graph-theoretic distance involves multiple edges, which will result in a longer path than the straight-line (Euclidean) distance. Hence:
