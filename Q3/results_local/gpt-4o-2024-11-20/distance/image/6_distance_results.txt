To assess the relationship between the Euclidean distance and the graph-theoretic distance between the source node (22) and the target node (9), we observe the following:

1. **Graph-theoretic distance**: This is the sum of the edge lengths along the shortest path in the graph. In the image, the path from the source node to the target node consists of three edges.

2. **Euclidean distance**: This is the straight-line distance between the source node and the target node. The Euclidean distance is shorter than the graph-theoretic distance because the graph path is not a straight lineâ€”it bends at intermediate nodes.

### Conclusion:
The Euclidean distance is less than the graph-theoretic distance.
