From the image:

- The graph-theoretic distance corresponds to the shortest path in terms of edges traversed between the source node (21) and target node (12). In this graph, the path consists of multiple edges.
- The Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between node 21 (source) and node 12 (target). Observing this, the straight-line distance is shorter compared to the total length of the path traversed along nodes.

Thus:
"Euclidean distance is less than graph-theoretic distance."
