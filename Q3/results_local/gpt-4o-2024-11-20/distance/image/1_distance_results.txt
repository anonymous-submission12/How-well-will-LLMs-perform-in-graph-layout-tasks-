To assess consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance:

1. **Graph-Theoretic Distance**: This is the shortest path between the source and target nodes, which is measured along the edges of the graph. Observing the graph, node 16 connects to node 7 through several intermediate nodes.

2. **Euclidean Distance**: This is the direct straight-line distance between node 16 (green) and node 7 (purple) on the plane.

From the visual representation:
- The Euclidean distance is computed as the straight-line segment between the source and target nodes, which is shorter compared to the total path distance (graph-theoretic distance) that follows the edges.

**Conclusion**: "Euclidean distance is less than graph-theoretic distance."
