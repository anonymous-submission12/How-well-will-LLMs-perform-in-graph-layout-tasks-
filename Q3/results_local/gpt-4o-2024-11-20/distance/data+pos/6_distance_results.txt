To assess the consistency between the Euclidean distance and the graph-theoretic distance for the given source node 22 and target node 9, we need to calculate both distances:

### Step 1: Calculate the Euclidean distance
The Euclidean distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
\[
d_{\text{Euclidean}} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
From the node coordinates:
- Node 22: \((-0.53, -0.55)\)
- Node 9: \((0.82, 0.53)\)

\[
d_{\text{Euclidean}} = \sqrt{(0.82 - (-0.53))^2 + (0.53 - (-0.55))^2}
\]
\[
d_{\text{Euclidean}} = \sqrt{(0.82 + 0.53)^2 + (0.53 + 0.55)^2}
\]
\[
d_{\text{Euclidean}} = \sqrt{(1.35)^2 + (1.08)^2}
\]
\[
d_{\text{Euclidean}} = \sqrt{1.8225 + 1.1664} = \sqrt{2.9889} \approx 1.73
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the graph-theoretic distance
The graph-theoretic distance is the shortest path between two nodes in the graph. From the subgraph data:
- The edges are: \((1, 8), (1, 19), (8, 9), (19, 22)\)
- The shortest path from node 22 to node 9 is: \(22 \to 19 \to 1 \to 8 \to 9\)
- This path has 4 edges.

Thus, the graph-theoretic distance is:
\[
d_{\text{graph}} = 4
\]

### Step 3: Compare the distances
- Euclidean distance: \(1.73\)
- Graph-theoretic distance: \(4\)

Since \(1.73 < 4\), the Euclidean distance is less than the graph-theoretic distance.
