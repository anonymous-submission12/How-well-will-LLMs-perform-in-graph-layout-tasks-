To assess the consistency between the Euclidean distance and the graph-theoretic distance, let us carefully evaluate the necessary calculations for source node 44 and target node 27.

1. **Graph-Theoretic Distance**:  
The graph-theoretic distance is the shortest path between the source node (44) and target node (27). Given the edges and subgraph data:
   ```
   - (44, 51)
   - (51, 22)
   - (22, 13)
   - (13, 17)
   - (32, 17)
   - (32, 27)
   ```
   The shortest path from node 44 to node 27 is:
   ```
   44 → 51 → 22 → 13 → 17 → 32 → 27
   ```
   Each edge contributes a distance of `1`. Thus, the **graph-theoretic distance** is:
   ```
   6
   ```

2. **Euclidean Distance**:  
Euclidean distance is computed using the formula:
   ```
   Euclidean distance = √((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²)
   ```
   For source node 44 (`[-0.55, 0.63]`) and target node 27 (`[0.69, -0.22]`):
   ```
   Euclidean distance = √((0.69 - (-0.55))² + ((-0.22) - 0.63)²)
                      = √((0.69 + 0.55)² + (-0.22 - 0.63)²)
                      = √((1.24)² + (-0.85)²)
                      = √(1.5376 + 0.7225)
                      = √2.2601
                      ≈ 1.503
   ```

3. **Comparison**:
   - Graph-theoretic distance = 6
   - Euclidean distance ≈ 1.503  
   Clearly, the **Euclidean distance is less than the graph-theoretic distance**.
