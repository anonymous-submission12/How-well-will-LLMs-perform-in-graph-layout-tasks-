To assess the consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, we will compute both measures:

1. **Graph-theoretic distance**: This is determined by the number of edges in the shortest path between the source node (25) and the target node (1). Based on the given subgraph data:
   ```
   (25) -> (24) -> (23) -> (22) -> (21) -> (20) -> (19) -> (18) -> (17) -> (16) -> (1)
   ```
   The graph-theoretic distance is **10** edges.

2. **Euclidean distance**: This is computed using the Euclidean formula for distances between two points in a 2D plane:
   ```
   Euclidean_distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)
   ```
   From the coordinates provided:
   - Node 25: [-0.33, -0.04]
   - Node 1: [0.56, -0.26]

   Substituting values into the formula:
   ```
   Euclidean_distance = sqrt((0.56 - (-0.33))^2 + (-0.26 - (-0.04))^2)
                      = sqrt((0.56 + 0.33)^2 + (-0.26 + 0.04)^2)
                      = sqrt((0.89)^2 + (-0.22)^2)
                      = sqrt(0.7921 + 0.0484)
                      = sqrt(0.8405)
                      â‰ˆ 0.9167 (approximately)
   ```

3. **Comparison**:
   - The graph-theoretic distance is **10**.
   - The Euclidean distance is approximately **0.9167**.

   Clearly, the Euclidean distance is **less than** the graph-theoretic distance.
