To evaluate the relationship between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance, let's compute the following steps:

---

### Step 1: Graph-theoretic distance
The graph-theoretic distance is determined by the shortest path (in terms of edges) connecting the source node (62) and the target node (24) in the graph data.

The edges in the provided graph subgraph are:
```
[(12, 13), (13, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 17), (17, 18), (18, 19), (19, 20), (20, 21), (21, 22), (22, 23), (23, 24), (37, 12), (37, 62)]
```

- The shortest path from `62` to `24` is:
  ```
  62 → 37 → 12 → 13 → 14 → 15 → 16 → 17 → 18 → 19 → 20 → 21 → 22 → 23 → 24
  ```
  This path has **14 edges**.

Thus, **graph-theoretic distance = 14.**

### Step 2: Euclidean distance
The Euclidean distance is calculated based on the coordinates provided for nodes `62` and `24`:
```
Coordinates of 62: [0.67, 0.26]
Coordinates of 24: [-0.84, 0.94]
```

The Euclidean distance formula is:
\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
d = \sqrt{((-0.84) - 0.67)^2 + ((0.94) - 0.26)^2}
\]
\[
d = \sqrt{(-1.51)^2 + (0.68)^2}
\]
\[
d = \sqrt{2.2801 + 0.4624}
\]
\[
d = \sqrt{2.7425}
\]
\[
d \approx 1.656.
\]

Thus, **Euclidean distance ≈ 1.656.**

---

### Step 3: Consistency assessment
- **Graph-theoretic distance = 14**
- **Euclidean distance ≈ 1.656**

Since the Euclidean distance (1.656) is significantly smaller than the graph-theoretic distance (14), the relationship between them is:
\[
\text{"Euclidean distance is less than graph-theoretic distance."}
\]
