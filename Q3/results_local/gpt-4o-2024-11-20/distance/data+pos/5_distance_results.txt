To assess the consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance for the source node 57 and target node 20, we need to calculate both distances:

### Step 1: Calculate Euclidean Distance
The Euclidean distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
Coordinates of node 57: \([-0.61, 0.7]\)  
Coordinates of node 20: \([0.65, 0.18]\)

\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(0.65 - (-0.61))^2 + (0.18 - 0.7)^2}
\]
\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(0.65 + 0.61)^2 + (0.18 - 0.7)^2}
\]
\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{(1.26)^2 + (-0.52)^2}
\]
\[
\text{Euclidean Distance} = \sqrt{1.5876 + 0.2704} = \sqrt{1.858} \approx 1.363
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Graph-Theoretic Distance
The graph-theoretic distance is the shortest path between nodes in terms of the number of edges. From the subgraph data, the path from node 57 to node 20 is:
\[
57 \to 56 \to 55 \to 54 \to 53 \to 52 \to 51 \to 50 \to 49 \to 48 \to 47 \to 46 \to 45 \to 44 \to 43 \to 42 \to 41 \to 40 \to 39 \to 38 \to 37 \to 36 \to 35 \to 34 \to 33 \to 32 \to 31 \to 30 \to 29 \to 28 \to 27 \to 26 \to 25 \to 24 \to 23 \to 22 \to 21 \to 20
\]
This path contains **37 edges**.

### Step 3: Compare Distances
- **Euclidean Distance**: \( \approx 1.363 \)
- **Graph-Theoretic Distance**: \( 37 \)

Clearly, the Euclidean distance is **less than** the graph-theoretic distance.
