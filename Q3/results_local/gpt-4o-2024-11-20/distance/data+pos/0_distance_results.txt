To assess whether the consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance is maintained between source node 5 and target node 14, we calculate the graph-theoretic distance (shortest path length in the subgraph) and the Euclidean distance (geometric distance between coordinates). The calculations are as follows:

### Graph-Theoretic Distance:
The graph-theoretic distance is the number of edges between nodes in the subgraph. Looking at the subgraph data:
```
(5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 12), (12, 13), (13, 14)
```
Node 5 is connected to node 6, node 6 to node 7, and so on, forming a consecutive path. Thus, the shortest path (graph-theoretic distance) from node 5 to node 14 traverses 9 edges. 

Graph-theoretic distance = 9.

### Euclidean Distance:
The Euclidean distance is computed using the coordinates of the nodes:

Node 5 coordinates: [0.58, -0.24]  
Node 14 coordinates: [-0.13, 0.67]  

The formula for Euclidean distance is:  
\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

Substituting the values:  
\[
d = \sqrt{(-0.13 - 0.58)^2 + (0.67 - (-0.24))^2}
\]
\[
d = \sqrt{(-0.71)^2 + (0.91)^2}
\]
\[
d = \sqrt{0.5041 + 0.8281}
\]
\[
d \approx \sqrt{1.3322} \approx 1.154
\]

Euclidean distance â‰ˆ 1.154.

### Comparison:
The graph-theoretic distance is 9, while the Euclidean distance is approximately 1.154.

Since 1.154 (Euclidean distance) is **less than** 9 (graph-theoretic distance), the consistency condition is not maintained.
