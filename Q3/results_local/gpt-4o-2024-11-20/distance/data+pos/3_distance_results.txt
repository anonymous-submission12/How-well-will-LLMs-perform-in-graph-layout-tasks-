To determine whether the consistency between Euclidean distance and graph-theoretic distance is maintained, we investigate the distances for the specified source node \(7\) and target node \(22\).

### Steps:
1. **Graph-Theoretic Distance**:
   - The graph-theoretic distance is the shortest path between nodes \(7\) and \(22\).
   - Based on the given subgraph, the path is directly connected through consecutive edges:
     \[
     (7, 8), (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 11), ..., (21, 22)
     \]
   - The number of edges in the shortest path from node \(7\) to node \(22\) is \(15\).
   - Therefore, the graph-theoretic distance is \(15\) (in terms of edge count).

2. **Euclidean Distance**:
   - The Euclidean distance \(\text{d}_{\text{Euclidean}}\) between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
     \[
     \text{d}_{\text{Euclidean}} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
     \]
   - Using the coordinates of node \(7\) (\(0.4, 0.74\)) and node \(22\) (\(-0.47, -0.4\)), we compute:
     \[
     \text{d}_{\text{Euclidean}} = \sqrt{(-0.47 - 0.4)^2 + (-0.4 - 0.74)^2}
     = \sqrt{(-0.87)^2 + (-1.14)^2}
     = \sqrt{0.7569 + 1.2996}
     = \sqrt{2.0565}
     \approx 1.434.
     \]

3. **Comparison**:
   - The Euclidean distance \(\approx 1.434\) is substantially **less than** the graph-theoretic distance of \(15\).
