To determine the relationship between the Euclidean distance and the graph-theoretic distance between the source node 3 and the target node 25, let's perform the necessary calculations step by step.

### Step 1: Graph-Theoretic Distance
The graph-theoretic distance is defined as the shortest path (in terms of number of edges) between two nodes in the graph. From the given subgraph data:
- Graph: [(1, 2), (1, 24), (2, 3), (24, 25)]

Shortest path from node 3 to node 25:
- 3 → 2 → 1 → 24 → 25 (length = 4 edges)

Thus, the **graph-theoretic distance** is 4.

### Step 2: Euclidean Distance
The Euclidean distance between two nodes is computed using the formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

From the given coordinates:
- Node 3: (0.33, 0.23)
- Node 25: (-0.77, 0.86)

Plugging in the coordinates:
\[
d = \sqrt{((-0.77 - 0.33)^2) + ((0.86 - 0.23)^2)}
\]
\[
d = \sqrt{((-1.1)^2) + ((0.63)^2)}
\]
\[
d = \sqrt{(1.21) + (0.3969)}
\]
\[
d = \sqrt{1.6069}
\]
\[
d \approx 1.2675
\]

Thus, the **Euclidean distance** is approximately **1.27**.

### Step 3: Compare Euclidean Distance and Graph-Theoretic Distance
- **Euclidean Distance**: ~1.27
- **Graph-Theoretic Distance**: 4

Clearly, the Euclidean distance (1.27) is less than the graph-theoretic distance (4).
