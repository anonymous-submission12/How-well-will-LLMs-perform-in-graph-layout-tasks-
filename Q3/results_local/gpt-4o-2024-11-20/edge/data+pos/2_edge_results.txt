To determine whether the two edges intersect, we need to analyze their coordinates:

Edge 1 connects nodes 0 and 4:
- Node 0: [-0.17, -0.0]
- Node 4: [-0.25, 0.14]

Edge 2 connects nodes 21 and 20:
- Node 21: [-0.0, -0.26]
- Node 20: [0.13, -0.27]

Now, we check if these two line segments intersect. We use the orientation test method from computational geometry to determine whether two line segments intersect.

### Steps:
1. **Calculate orientations**: 
   Orientation of points is determined using the determinant:
   ```
   Orientation(p, q, r) = (q_x - p_x) * (r_y - p_y) - (q_y - p_y) * (r_x - p_x)
   ```
   Based on its sign, it can either be clockwise, counterclockwise, or collinear.

2. **Check for intersection conditions**:
   Two edges intersect if:
   - The orientations of the points on one edge with respect to the other edge straddle (one clockwise and one counterclockwise).
   - Special case: collinear points where intersection overlaps.

### Calculations:
Let `p1 = [-0.17, -0.0]`, `p2 = [-0.25, 0.14]`, `q1 = [-0.0, -0.26]`, and `q2 = [0.13, -0.27]`.

#### Orientation tests:
- Orientation of (p1, p2, q1):  
  ```
  (-0.25 + 0.17) * (-0.26 + 0.0) - (0.14 - 0.0) *
