To determine whether the two edges intersect, we consider their respective node coordinates:

Edge 1: Between nodes 24 and 15  
Coordinates: Node 24 (-0.15, 0.19), Node 15 (-0.21, 0.26)

Edge 2: Between nodes 46 and 49  
Coordinates: Node 46 (0.36, 0.1), Node 49 (0.33, 0.01)

Now, let's calculate whether the line segments defined by these two edges intersect. For line segment intersection, we use a standard computational geometry method based on the orientation test.

### Steps to determine intersection:
1. Define the four points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), \( D \):  
   \( A \) = (-0.15, 0.19), \( B \) = (-0.21, 0.26)  
   \( C \) = (0.36, 0.1), \( D \) = (0.33, 0.01)

2. Compute orientations to verify if lines intersect:
   Orientation is determined by the cross product of vectors. Intersection occurs if the orientations indicate the points \( A, B \) straddle \( C, D \), and \( C, D \) straddle \( A, B \).

3. Solve for the intersection condition:
   After checking orientation conditions, we determine if the two line segments intersect.

### Final determination:
After applying the geometric calculations, **the two edges do not intersect**.
