To determine whether the two edges intersect, we calculate if the line segments representing the edges have a point of intersection. Here's the step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Extract coordinates for edges
- Edge 1 connects nodes `46` and `60`:
  - Node `46`: `(-0.62, 0.53)`
  - Node `60`: `(-0.63, 0.62)`

- Edge 2 connects nodes `52` and `61`:
  - Node `52`: `(-0.4, 0.69)`
  - Node `61`: `(-0.75, 0.54)`

### Step 2: Check for intersection using the line segment method
We check if two line segments intersect using their endpoints and orientation tests. Specifically:
1. **Orientation test**: This uses a cross-product calculation to determine if two points are located on opposite sides of a segment.
2. **Bounding boxes**: If two segments overlap through their bounding boxes, itâ€™s a potential intersection.

Performing the calculations manually:
- After testing the orientation for all points and bounding boxes, **the two edges do intersect geometrically.**
