To determine if two edges intersect, we need to check whether the line segments formed by the two pairs of node coordinates intersect. Here are the steps:

### Input
Edges: [(1, 2), (3, 5)]  
Coordinates: {'1': [0.61, 0.16], '2': [0.7, -0.1], '3': [0.49, 0.0], '5': [0.74, 0.07]}  

### Steps
1. Get coordinates for each node:
   - Node 1: [0.61, 0.16]
   - Node 2: [0.7, -0.1]
   - Node 3: [0.49, 0.0]
   - Node 5: [0.74, 0.07]

2. Represent edges as line segments:  
   - Edge 1-2: Segment (0.61, 0.16) to (0.7, -0.1)  
   - Edge 3-5: Segment (0.49, 0.0) to (0.74, 0.07)

3. Use the 2D line segment intersection formula:
   To check whether two line segments intersect, we calculate the orientations of the endpoint pairs and ensure that they "cross" each other. This involves:

   - Directed orientation checks for the endpoints using the cross-product.
   - Verifying if their projections overlap when extended infinitely.

4. Compute orientation and intersection:
   After performing the geometric checks, the result is that the edges **do not** intersect.
