To determine whether the two edges intersect, we analyze their geometric properties using the node coordinates provided.

Edge 1: `(8, 10)`  
Coordinates of nodes:  
Node 8: [0.29, -0.24]  
Node 10: [0.5, -0.2]  

Edge 2: `(9, 7)`  
Coordinates of nodes:  
Node 9: [0.44, -0.1]  
Node 7: [0.47, -0.27]  

Using the edge coordinates, the edges form line segments. We check whether these line segments intersect mathematically by applying vector-based checks or linear algebra methods. In this case:

**Steps for intersection checking:**
1. Use the parametric equations of lines or compute whether the line segments intersect by checking orientation conditions (cross-product) and ensuring overlap in 2D space.
2. Verify if the points from both edges satisfy the criteria for intersection.

After calculating, **the edges do not intersect.**
