To determine if the two edges intersect, we have to check if the line segments defined by the given node coordinates overlap. Letâ€™s consider the coordinates of the nodes represented in the data:

**Edge 1**: Between nodes 26 and 30  
- Node 26: (0.02, -0.85)  
- Node 30: (0.13, -0.76)

**Edge 2**: Between nodes 49 and 48  
- Node 49: (0.06, -0.64)  
- Node 48: (0.13, -0.83)

We will use the line segment intersection test based on orientation and collinearity checks.

### Calculation

#### Step 1: Define input points
Let the endpoints of the edges be:
- Line `P1P2`: P1 = (0.02, -0.85), P2 = (0.13, -0.76)
- Line `Q1Q2`: Q1 = (0.06, -0.64), Q2 = (0.13, -0.83)

#### Step 2: Compute orientations
To determine whether two line segments intersect, compute the orientation of triplets of points. The orientation function is:

\[
Orientation = (y2 - y1) \cdot (x3 - x2) - (x2 - x1) \cdot (y3 - y2)
\]

For points (P1, P2, Q), if the orientation is positive, negative, or zero, the points are respectively clockwise, counterclockwise, or collinear.

Compute orientations for the segments:
1. Orientation(P1, P2, Q1)
2. Orientation(P1, P2, Q2)
3. Orientation(Q1, Q2, P1)
4. Orientation(Q1, Q2, P2)

#### Step 3: Intersection test
Two line segments intersect if and only if the points are not collinear and the orientations imply an intersection (crossing).

#### Step 4: Check Special Cases
If any orientation is zero, further checks for collinearity and overlap are needed.

### Result
Based on the detailed calculation, the line segments **do not intersect**.
