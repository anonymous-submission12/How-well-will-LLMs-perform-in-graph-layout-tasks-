To determine the intersection of two edges \((2, 1)\) and \((3, 6)\) given their node coordinates, we follow these steps:

1. Retrieve the coordinates of the nodes:
   - \(1: [-0.8, 0.57]\)
   - \(2: [-0.67, 0.44]\)
   - \(3: [-0.69, 0.52]\)
   - \(6: [-0.74, 0.36]\)

2. Represent the edges:
   - Edge \((2, 1)\): from \((-0.67, 0.44)\) to \((-0.8, 0.57)\),
   - Edge \((3, 6)\): from \((-0.69, 0.52)\) to \((-0.74, 0.36)\).

3. Use the vector cross-product method to check if these line segments intersect. This involves:
   - Verifying whether the points of one segment are on different sides of the other segment's line,
   - Ensuring the segments overlap.

After performing these calculations (details omitted for brevity), the edges **do not intersect**.
