First, let's understand the problem and the data given: 

We are provided with two edges:
- First edge connects nodes 13 and 21.
- Second edge connects nodes 22 and 6.

We also have the coordinates of the nodes:
- Node 13: [0.16, 0.36]
- Node 21: [0.35, 0.56]
- Node 22: [0.23, 0.51]
- Node 6:  [0.43, 0.37]

To determine whether the edges intersect, we can calculate if the two line segments, represented by the given edges based on their coordinates, intersect. This is done using a standard geometric approach for line segment intersection.

The key idea is to use the *orientation test*:
1. For each pair of segments, determine the orientation of endpoints with respect to the other segment.
2. If the orientations indicate that the two segments "cross" each other, the segments intersect.

The steps are as follows:

### 1. Represent the segments:
- Segment 1: (13, 21) = (0.16, 0.36) to (0.35, 0.56)
- Segment 2: (22, 6)  = (0.23, 0.51) to (0.43, 0.37)

### 2. Determine orientation:
The orientation of three points (p, q, r) can be determined using the cross product:
- Orientation = (q_y - p_y) * (r_x - q_x) - (q_x - p_x) * (r_y - q_y)

### 3. Compute intersection:
We check the orientations of the endpoints of one segment relative to the other. If they differ in a specific way, the segments intersect.

Hereâ€™s the result:

After computing the orientations using the above method, **the two edges intersect**.
