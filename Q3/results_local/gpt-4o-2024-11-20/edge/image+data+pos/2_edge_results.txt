To determine whether the edges intersect, we perform the line segment intersection test using the provided coordinates. 

The edges are defined as:
1. Edge 1: between nodes `0` and `4`.
2. Edge 2: between nodes `21` and `20`.

**Coordinates:**
- Node `0`: `[-0.17, -0.0]`
- Node `4`: `[-0.25, 0.14]`
- Node `21`: `[-0.0, -0.26]`
- Node `20`: `[0.13, -0.27]`

The edge coordinates are:
- Edge 1: `[-0.17, -0.0]` → `[-0.25, 0.14]`
- Edge 2: `[-0.0, -0.26]` → `[0.13, -0.27]`

The geometry of the two edges indicates that they do not overlap in the given space (based on relative positions and slopes of the edges).

**Final Result:**

  "Answer": "No"
