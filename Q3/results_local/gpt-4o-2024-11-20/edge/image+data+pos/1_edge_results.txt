To determine whether the edges (2, 1) and (3, 6) intersect, we can apply the line segment intersection formula using their respective coordinates.

### Node Coordinates:
- Node 1: `[-0.8, 0.57]`
- Node 2: `[-0.67, 0.44]`
- Node 3: `[-0.69, 0.52]`
- Node 6: `[-0.74, 0.36]`

### Step-by-Step Method:
1. **Edge 1 (2, 1)**: 
   - Start point: `[-0.67, 0.44]`
   - End point: `[-0.8, 0.57]`

2. **Edge 2 (3, 6)**:
   - Start point: `[-0.69, 0.52]`
   - End point: `[-0.74, 0.36]`

Using the line segment intersection test, we know:
A pair of line segments intersects if the orientations of each segment relative to the endpoints of the other segment differ (using determinant-based calculations).

After performing the calculations (or observing the visual), we can see that these edges **do intersect**.
