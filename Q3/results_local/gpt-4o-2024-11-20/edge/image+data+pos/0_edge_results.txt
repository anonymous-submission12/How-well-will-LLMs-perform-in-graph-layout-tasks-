To determine whether the line segments intersect, we can use a mathematical approach based on the orientation of the points.

**Steps to determine intersection:**
1. Compute the orientation of ordered triplets of points using the cross-product formula.
2. Check if the line segments intersect based on orientation values.

**The given line segments:**
- Segment 1: From node 26 to node 30: Points (0.02, -0.85) and (0.13, -0.76)
- Segment 2: From node 49 to node 48: Points (0.06, -0.64) and (0.13, -0.83)

**Orientation Formula:**
For three points \( p = (x_1, y_1) \), \( q = (x_2, y_2) \), \( r = (x_3, y_3) \):
\[
\text{Orientation}(p, q, r) = (q_y - p_y) \cdot (r_x - q_x) - (q_x - p_x) \cdot (r_y - q_y)
\]
- Result > 0: Clockwise
- Result < 0: Counterclockwise
- Result = 0: Collinear

### Case-by-Case Analysis:
1. Compute orientations for points defining both lines.
2. Check general intersection conditions using a combination of clock-wise and counterclock-wise orientations.

**Intersection Status:**  
After computing orientations and verifying, the results show that the two edges do intersect.
